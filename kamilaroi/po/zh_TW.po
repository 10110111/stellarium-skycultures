"卡米拉羅伊人（又稱戈梅羅瓦人）和Euahlayi人是位於新南威爾士州北部的澳大利亞土著文化群體。他們在歐洲的入侵和大部分國家的滅亡中倖免於難。他們的文化和與國家的聯繫仍然很牢固，其中包括1860年代首次記錄的廣泛的文化天文學。"

"This Stellarium Skyculture is the result of a Higher Degree Research project by Robert Fuller at Macquarie University, Sydney, finished in 2014. Stellarium was chosen as a part of the project for Giving Back of the collected knowledge to the Kamilaroi and Euahlayi communities in the form of a documentary video (Star Stories of the Dreaming) and a student's Study Guide. Clips from the Stellarium were used in the documentary to illustrate certain sky objects.\n"

"### Constellations: Cultural objects\n"
"\n"
"##### Gawaargay\n"
"\n"
"Gawaargay is the spirit Emu in the Sky, located with its head in the Coal Sack, and its neck and body stretching out through the dust lanes of the Milky Way (Warrambul) past Scorpius. The Euahlayi and the Kamilaroi see it with legs in April and May, when it is female and chasing the males. From June to August it is male and sitting on its nest without legs (the males brood the chicks), and this is a signal to collect the eggs. In the evening in late August it is vertical in the sky, and the head and body form two \"eggs\", meaning the eggs should not be collected. Later in the year, it appears on the horizon, so it is believed to be sitting in a waterhole, meaning the waterholes are full. When it is below the horizon, then it is on Earth as the Black Emu, which is rarely seen.\n"
"\n"
"##### Birringoloo\n"
"\n"
"Birringoloo is the second wife of Byaame, the creator/culture hero. She sits by the campfire of Byaame's camp (the star Alpha Muscae), and all women with girl children who die come to this camp before going on to Bulimah (Heaven behind Warrambul). They wait at this camp until all their girl children have died and come to the camp, and then they can proceed to Bulimah.\n"
"\n"
"##### Yarran\n"
"\n"
"Yarran (also called mingga) is the roots of the Yarran tree, an Acacia, which is the tree that Byaame took up to the Warrambul with the first man to die (and the Cockatoos). It is actually centred on the Coal Sack, and the dark nebula is the hollow of the tree seen from below, with the roots spreading around. When someone dies and goes to Bulimah, they go through the hollow of the Yarran.\n"
"\n"
"##### Old Wiringin\n"
"\n"
"A Wiringin is a \"Clever Man\" or Aboriginal doctor. This Wiringin located in the Small Magellanic Cloud is there because he controls who can go on to Bulimah. If the person who died is not initiated, they are not allowed, because they don't know the rules, so he sends them to Wadhaagudjaaylwan in the Large Magellanic Cloud. This birth spirit will send the unitiated back to Earth as a new baby, so they can be initiated. This Wiringin is represented in every Aboriginal cemetary as the Wilga tree (Native Willow).\n"
"\n"
"##### Birray Birray\n"
"\n"
"The Birray Birray are a group of uninitiated boys who are in love with the seven young women (sisters), Miyay Miyay, who make up the Pleiades star cluster. They chased the Miyay Miyay, who ended up in the sky, and for this they were placed in Orion, as the three stars that make up the belt of Orion. Rigel is their fire, and the sword of Orion is their fire poker. They are kept from the Miyay Miyay by the Wiringin, Old Dthillar, who is Aldebaran.\n"
"\n"
"##### Miyay Miyay\n"
"\n"
"The Miyay Miyay are the seven young women (sisters) who were chased into the sky, depending on the story, by the Birray Birray, or by various Wiringins or other bad persons. They form the Pleiades star cluster, and as one sister is shy, normally we only see six stars. They are protected from the Birray Birray in Orion by the Wiringin, Old Dthillar, who is Aldebaran.\n"
"\n"
"##### Old Dthillar\n"
"\n"
"Old Dthillar is a Wiringin, in this case the Wiringin of the Birray Birray, the unitiated boys in Orion who pine for the Miyaay Miyaay (Seven Sisters) in the Pleiades. Old Dthillar is the star Aldebaran, which is also Alpha Tauri, and he stands there to protect the Miyaay Miyaay from the Birray Birray. The inverted \"V\" shape made up by Alpha, Epsilon, and Gamma Tauri is Old Dthillar's gunya (hut).\n"
"\n"
"##### Wamba Wamba\n"
"\n"
"\"Wamba\" means \"crazy\" or \"mad\". In this case, the star Canopus is called Wamba Wamba because of various reasons, depending on whose story is told. The planet Venus is also called Wamba. One speculation is that both Canopus and Venus are seen close to the horizon in the summer, and due to atmospheric defraction, can \"scintillate\" (twinkle srongly), which results in rapid changes in colour. This might be interpreted as madness.\n"
"\n"
"##### Wadhaagudjaaylwan\n"
"\n"
"Wadhaagudjaaylwan is Byaame's third wife, who is in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and sings to women who are going to have babies. She \"sings\" the babies to the women on Earth, and she takes the persons that the Old Wiringin in the Small Magellanic Cloud sends to her, and sends them back to Earth as babies.\n"
"\n"
"##### Bandaarr\n"
"\n"
"Bandaarr is Kamilaroi/Euahlayi for Kangaroo, and this kangaroo is located under the belly of the Emu in the Milky Way, looking away from the Emu. Bandaarr is either a grey or red kangaroo, depending on the culture, and has significance in ceremony.\n"
"\n"
"##### Muraay Muyaay\n"
"\n"
"Muraay is Kamilaroi, and Muyaay is Euahlayi for the sulfur-crested cockatoo, who are the Pointer stars (Alpha Centauri and Hadar/Beta Centauri). They ended up in the constellation Crux when their tree, the Yarran, was dragged into the sky with the first man to die, and they are always chasing Yarran.\n"
"\n"
"##### Warrawilbaarru\n"
"\n"
"Warrawilbaarru is the whirlwind spirit who lives in the constellation Scorpius. Byaame normally keeps him from coming to Earth, but in September he comes out of one of three holes (dark nebulae) in Scorpius during September, and doesn't go back until around March. During this time he is on earth as the \"willy willy\" or whirlwind, and can be dangerous to children and uninitiated men."

"這種恆星的天空文化是悉尼麥格理大學的羅伯特·富勒（Robert Fuller）於2014年完成的一項高等研究項目的結果。恆星被選為該項目的一部分，以回饋形式將所收集的知識回饋給Kamilaroi和Euahlayi社區。紀錄片（夢中的星空故事）和學生的學習指南。紀錄片中使用了恆星的剪輯來說明某些天空物體。\n"
"\n"
"###星座：文物\n"
"\n"
"##### Gawaargay\n"
"\n"
"Gawaargay是天空中的靈魂E，其頭部位於煤袋中，其頸部和身體從銀河系（Warrambul）的塵土通道中伸出，經過天蠍座。 Euahlayi和Kamilaroi分別在四月和五月看到它的雌性並追逐雄性時用腿看到它。從六月到八月，它是雄性，坐在其上沒有腿的巢中（雄性繁殖雛雞），這是一個收集卵的信號。在八月下旬的傍晚，天空是垂直的，頭部和身體形成兩個“蛋”，這意味著不應該收集卵。在今年晚些時候，它出現在地平線上，因此據信它坐落在一個水坑中，這意味著水坑已滿。當它在地平線以下時，它在地球上就是黑色Black，這是很少見的。\n"
"\n"
"##### Birringoloo\n"
"\n"
"Birringoloo是創建者/文化英雄Byaame的第二任妻子。她坐在Byaame的營地（星Alpha Muscae）的篝火旁，所有死去有女嬰的婦女都來到這個營地，然後前往Bulimah（位於Warrambul後面的天堂）。他們在這個營地等待，直到所有女童都死了，然後來到營地，然後他們才能前往Bulimah。\n"
"\n"
"#####亞倫\n"
"\n"
"Yarran（也稱為mingga）是Yarran樹的樹根，這是一種相思樹，是Byaame與第一個死者（和鳳頭鸚鵡）一起被帶到Warrambul的樹。它實際上以煤袋為中心，黑暗的星雲是從下面看的樹的空心，其根遍布周圍。當某人死亡並前往Bulimah時，他們會穿過Yarran的空洞。\n"
"\n"
"##### Old Wiringin\n"
"\n"
"Wiringin是“聰明人”或原住民醫生。這個位於小麥哲倫星雲中的Wiringin在那裡，因為他控制著誰可以去Bulimah。如果死亡者沒有被發起，則因為他們不了解規則而被禁止，因此他將規則發送給麥哲倫星雲中的Wadhaagudjaaylwan。這種出生的精神將把他們作為新的嬰兒送回地球，因此他們可以被啟迪。 Wiringin在每個原住民墓地中都被稱為Wilga樹（原生柳樹）。\n"
"\n"
"##### Birray Birray\n"
"\n"
"Birray Birray是一群未成年的男孩，他們愛上了組成le宿星團的七個年輕婦女（姐妹）Miyay Miyay。他們追逐了最終落入天空的米耶·米耶（Miyay Miyay），為此，他們被安排在獵戶座（Orion）中，作為組成獵戶座地帶的三顆星。里格爾是他們的火，獵戶座的劍是他們的火撲克。他們是由維丁格林（Old Dthillar），也是奧爾德巴蘭（Aldebaran）所庇護的。\n"
"\n"
"##### Miyay Miyay\n"
"\n"
"米亞伊·米亞伊（Miyay Miyay）是七個故事的年輕女性（姐妹），根據故事的不同，被伯雷·伯瑞，各種Wiringins或其他壞人追趕到了天空。它們形成the宿星團，由於一個姐姐很害羞，通常我們只看到六顆星。他們受到奧爾林德·奧古斯丁·維德林·奧爾蒂巴蘭（Orthin Dthillar）的保護，免受獵戶座的比雷（Birray Birray）襲擊。\n"
"\n"
"#####老Dthillar\n"
"\n"
"老Dthillar是一名Wiringin，在本例中為Birray Birray的Wiringin，他是獵戶座的同盟男孩，他們在P宿星系中的Miyaay Miyaay（七姐妹）松樹。老迪斯拉爾是Aldebaran明星，也是Alpha Tauri明星，他站在那裡保護Miyaay Miyaay免受Birray Birray的傷害。由阿爾法（Alpha），厄普西隆（Epsilon）和伽瑪·塔里（Gamma Tauri）組成的倒“ V”字形，是老Dthillar的古雅色（小屋）。\n"
"\n"
"##### Wamba Wamba\n"
"\n"
"“ Wamba”的意思是“瘋狂”或“瘋狂”。在這種情況下，恆星Canopus由於種種原因而被稱為Wamba Wamba，這取決於講述誰的故事。金星行星也稱為萬巴。一種推測是，在夏季，Canopus和Venus都可以在地平線附近看到，並且由於大氣折射，會“閃爍”（錯誤地閃爍），從而導致顏色快速變化。這可能被解釋為瘋狂。\n"
"\n"
"##### Wadhaagudjaaylwan\n"
"\n"
"Wadhaagudjaaylwan是Byaame的第三任妻子，她在大麥哲倫星雲中唱歌，並向將要生育的婦女唱歌。她向地球上的婦女“唱歌”給嬰兒，然後把麥哲倫小雲中的老維林格林送給她的人帶回去，並把它們作為嬰兒送回地球。\n"
"\n"
"##### Bandaarr\n"
"\n"
"Bandaarr是袋鼠的Kamilaroi / Euahlayi，這只袋鼠位於銀河系the的腹部下方，背對mu。根據文化的不同，班達亞是灰色或紅色的袋鼠，在儀式上具有重要意義。\n"
"\n"
"##### Muraay Muyaay\n"
"\n"
"Muraay是卡米拉羅伊（Kamilaroi），Muyaay是硫磺鳳頭鸚鵡的Euahlayi，它們是尖星（Alpha Centauri和Hadar / Beta Centauri）。當他們的樹Yarran被第一個死去的人拖入天空時，他們最終進入了Crux星座。他們一直在追逐Yarran。\n"
"\n"
"##### Warrawilbaarru\n"
"\n"
"Warrawilbaarru是居住在天蠍座的旋風精神。 Byaame通常不會讓他進入地球，但是在9月，他在9月從天蠍座的三個洞（暗星雲）之一出來，直到3月左右才返回。在這段時間裡，他以“威利·威利”或旋風在地上生活，可能對兒童和未成年男子構成危險。"
