"This Stellarium Skyculture is the result of a Higher Degree Research project by Robert Fuller at Macquarie University, Sydney, finished in 2014. Stellarium was chosen as a part of the project for Giving Back of the collected knowledge to the Kamilaroi and Euahlayi communities in the form of a documentary video (Star Stories of the Dreaming) and a student's Study Guide. Clips from the Stellarium were used in the documentary to illustrate certain sky objects.\n"

"### Constellations: Cultural objects\n"
"\n"
"##### Gawaargay\n"
"\n"
"Gawaargay is the spirit Emu in the Sky, located with its head in the Coal Sack, and its neck and body stretching out through the dust lanes of the Milky Way (Warrambul) past Scorpius. The Euahlayi and the Kamilaroi see it with legs in April and May, when it is female and chasing the males. From June to August it is male and sitting on its nest without legs (the males brood the chicks), and this is a signal to collect the eggs. In the evening in late August it is vertical in the sky, and the head and body form two \"eggs\", meaning the eggs should not be collected. Later in the year, it appears on the horizon, so it is believed to be sitting in a waterhole, meaning the waterholes are full. When it is below the horizon, then it is on Earth as the Black Emu, which is rarely seen.\n"
"\n"
"##### Birringoloo\n"
"\n"
"Birringoloo is the second wife of Byaame, the creator/culture hero. She sits by the campfire of Byaame's camp (the star Alpha Muscae), and all women with girl children who die come to this camp before going on to Bulimah (Heaven behind Warrambul). They wait at this camp until all their girl children have died and come to the camp, and then they can proceed to Bulimah.\n"
"\n"
"##### Yarran\n"
"\n"
"Yarran (also called mingga) is the roots of the Yarran tree, an Acacia, which is the tree that Byaame took up to the Warrambul with the first man to die (and the Cockatoos). It is actually centred on the Coal Sack, and the dark nebula is the hollow of the tree seen from below, with the roots spreading around. When someone dies and goes to Bulimah, they go through the hollow of the Yarran.\n"
"\n"
"##### Old Wiringin\n"
"\n"
"A Wiringin is a \"Clever Man\" or Aboriginal doctor. This Wiringin located in the Small Magellanic Cloud is there because he controls who can go on to Bulimah. If the person who died is not initiated, they are not allowed, because they don't know the rules, so he sends them to Wadhaagudjaaylwan in the Large Magellanic Cloud. This birth spirit will send the unitiated back to Earth as a new baby, so they can be initiated. This Wiringin is represented in every Aboriginal cemetary as the Wilga tree (Native Willow).\n"
"\n"
"##### Birray Birray\n"
"\n"
"The Birray Birray are a group of uninitiated boys who are in love with the seven young women (sisters), Miyay Miyay, who make up the Pleiades star cluster. They chased the Miyay Miyay, who ended up in the sky, and for this they were placed in Orion, as the three stars that make up the belt of Orion. Rigel is their fire, and the sword of Orion is their fire poker. They are kept from the Miyay Miyay by the Wiringin, Old Dthillar, who is Aldebaran.\n"
"\n"
"##### Miyay Miyay\n"
"\n"
"The Miyay Miyay are the seven young women (sisters) who were chased into the sky, depending on the story, by the Birray Birray, or by various Wiringins or other bad persons. They form the Pleiades star cluster, and as one sister is shy, normally we only see six stars. They are protected from the Birray Birray in Orion by the Wiringin, Old Dthillar, who is Aldebaran.\n"
"\n"
"##### Old Dthillar\n"
"\n"
"Old Dthillar is a Wiringin, in this case the Wiringin of the Birray Birray, the unitiated boys in Orion who pine for the Miyaay Miyaay (Seven Sisters) in the Pleiades. Old Dthillar is the star Aldebaran, which is also Alpha Tauri, and he stands there to protect the Miyaay Miyaay from the Birray Birray. The inverted \"V\" shape made up by Alpha, Epsilon, and Gamma Tauri is Old Dthillar's gunya (hut).\n"
"\n"
"##### Wamba Wamba\n"
"\n"
"\"Wamba\" means \"crazy\" or \"mad\". In this case, the star Canopus is called Wamba Wamba because of various reasons, depending on whose story is told. The planet Venus is also called Wamba. One speculation is that both Canopus and Venus are seen close to the horizon in the summer, and due to atmospheric defraction, can \"scintillate\" (twinkle srongly), which results in rapid changes in colour. This might be interpreted as madness.\n"
"\n"
"##### Wadhaagudjaaylwan\n"
"\n"
"Wadhaagudjaaylwan is Byaame's third wife, who is in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and sings to women who are going to have babies. She \"sings\" the babies to the women on Earth, and she takes the persons that the Old Wiringin in the Small Magellanic Cloud sends to her, and sends them back to Earth as babies.\n"
"\n"
"##### Bandaarr\n"
"\n"
"Bandaarr is Kamilaroi/Euahlayi for Kangaroo, and this kangaroo is located under the belly of the Emu in the Milky Way, looking away from the Emu. Bandaarr is either a grey or red kangaroo, depending on the culture, and has significance in ceremony.\n"
"\n"
"##### Muraay Muyaay\n"
"\n"
"Muraay is Kamilaroi, and Muyaay is Euahlayi for the sulfur-crested cockatoo, who are the Pointer stars (Alpha Centauri and Hadar/Beta Centauri). They ended up in the constellation Crux when their tree, the Yarran, was dragged into the sky with the first man to die, and they are always chasing Yarran.\n"
"\n"
"##### Warrawilbaarru\n"
"\n"
"Warrawilbaarru is the whirlwind spirit who lives in the constellation Scorpius. Byaame normally keeps him from coming to Earth, but in September he comes out of one of three holes (dark nebulae) in Scorpius during September, and doesn't go back until around March. During this time he is on earth as the \"willy willy\" or whirlwind, and can be dangerous to children and uninitiated men."

"这种恒星的天空文化是悉尼麦格理大学的罗伯特·富勒（Robert Fuller）于2014年完成的一项高等研究项目的结果。恒星被选为该项目的一部分，以以下形式将所收集的知识回馈给Kamilaroi和Euahlayi社区纪录片（梦中的星空故事）和学生的学习指南。纪录片中使用了恒星的剪辑来说明某些天空物体。\n"
"\n"
"###星座：文物\n"
"\n"
"##### Gawaargay\n"
"\n"
"Gawaargay是天空中的灵魂E，其头部位于煤袋中，其颈部和身体从银河系（Warrambul）的尘土通道中伸出，经过天蝎座。 Euahlayi和Kamilaroi分别在四月和五月看到它，当时它是雌性并追逐雄性。从六月到八月，它是雄性，坐在其上没有腿的巢中（雄性繁殖雏鸡），这是一个收集卵的信号。在8月下旬的傍晚，天空是垂直的，头部和身体形成了两个“蛋”，这意味着不应该收集卵。在今年晚些时候，它出现在地平线上，因此据信它坐落在一个水坑中，这意味着水坑已满。当它在地平线以下时，它在地球上就是黑色Black，这是很少见的。\n"
"\n"
"##### Birringoloo\n"
"\n"
"Birringoloo是创建者/文化英雄Byaame的第二任妻子。她坐在Byaame营地（星Alpha Muscae）的篝火旁，所有有女婴的死去的妇女都来到这个营地，然后前往Bulimah（位于Warrambul后面的天堂）。他们在这个营地等待，直到所有女童都死了，然后来到营地，然后他们才能前往Bulimah。\n"
"\n"
"#####亚伦\n"
"\n"
"Yarran（也称为mingga）是Yarran树的树种，它是一种相思树，是Byaame与第一个死者（和凤头鹦鹉）一起死于Warrambul的树。它实际上以煤袋为中心，黑暗的星云是从下面看的树的空心，其根遍布周围。当某人死亡并前往Bulimah时，他们会穿过Yarran的空洞。\n"
"\n"
"##### Old Wiringin\n"
"\n"
"Wiringin是“聪明人”或原住民医生。这个位于小麦哲伦星云中的Wiringin在那里，因为他控制着谁可以去Bulimah。如果死者没有被发起，则因为他们不了解规则而被禁止，所以他将规则发送给麦哲伦星云中的Wadhaagudjaaylwan。这种出生的精神将把他们作为新的婴儿送回地球，因此他们可以被启迪。 Wiringin在每个原住民墓地中都被称为Wilga树（原生柳树）。\n"
"\n"
"##### Birray Birray\n"
"\n"
"Birray Birray是一群未成年的男孩，他们爱上了组成le宿星团的七个年轻妇女（姐妹）Miyay Miyay。他们追赶了最终冲上天空的Miyay Miyay，为此，他们被安置在Orion中，作为组成Orion地带的三颗星。里格尔是他们的火，猎户座的剑是他们的火扑克。他们由维丁·奥古斯丁（Old Dthillar）与Aliyabaran隔离在Miyay Miyay。\n"
"\n"
"##### Miyay Miyay\n"
"\n"
"米亚伊·米亚伊（Miyay Miyay）是七个故事的年轻女性（姐妹），根据故事的不同，被伯雷·伯瑞，各种Wiringins或其他坏人追赶到了天空。它们形成the宿星团，由于一个姐姐很害羞，通常我们只看到六颗星。他们受到奥尔丁（Ordebaran）威林金（Old Dthillar）的保护，免受Orion的Birray Birray的袭击。\n"
"\n"
"#####老Dthillar\n"
"\n"
"老Dthillar是一名Wiringin，在本例中为Birray Birray的Wiringin，他是猎户座的团结男孩，他们在for宿星系的Miyaay Miyaay（七姐妹）中松树。老迪斯拉尔是Aldebaran明星，也是Alpha Tauri明星，他站在那里保护Miyaay Miyaay免受Birray Birray的伤害。由Alpha，Epsilon和Gamma Tauri组成的“ V”字形是老Dthillar的古雅色（小屋）。\n"
"\n"
"##### Wamba Wamba\n"
"\n"
"“ Wamba”的意思是“疯狂”或“疯狂”。在这种情况下，恒星Canopus由于种种原因而被称为Wamba Wamba，这取决于讲述谁的故事。金星行星也称为万巴。一种推测是，在夏季，Canopus和Venus都可以在地平线附近看到，并且由于大气折射，会“闪烁”（错误地闪烁），从而导致颜色快速变化。这可能被解释为疯狂。\n"
"\n"
"##### Wadhaagudjaaylwan\n"
"\n"
"Wadhaagudjaaylwan是Byaame的第三任妻子，她在大麦哲伦星云中唱歌，并向将要生育的妇女唱歌。她向地球上的妇女“唱歌”给婴儿，然后将麦哲伦小云中的老维林格林送给她的人带回去，并把它们作为婴儿送回地球。\n"
"\n"
"##### Bandaarr\n"
"\n"
"Bandaarr是袋鼠的Kamilaroi / Euahlayi，它是袋鼠，位于银河系the的腹部下方，背对E。根据文化的不同，班达亚是灰色或红色的袋鼠，在仪式上具有重要意义。\n"
"\n"
"##### Muraay Muyaay\n"
"\n"
"Muraay是卡米拉罗伊（Kamilaroi），Muyaay是硫磺凤头鹦鹉的Euahlayi，它们是尖星（Alpha Centauri和Hadar / Beta Centauri）。当他们的树Yarran被第一个死去的人拖入天空时，他们最终进入了Crux星座。他们一直在追逐Yarran。\n"
"\n"
"##### Warrawilbaarru\n"
"\n"
"Warrawilbaarru是居住在天蝎座的旋风精神。 Byaame通常不会让他进入地球，但是在9月，他在9月从天蝎座的三个洞（暗星云）之一出来，直到3月左右才返回。在这段时间里，他以“威利·威利”或旋风在地上生活，可能对儿童和未成年男子构成危险。"
