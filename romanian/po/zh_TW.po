"Considered as a whole, Romanian popular stellar mythology has three essential components.\n"
"\n"
"The FIRST one - the ancestral pastoral-agricultural is pre-Christian, in which the sky seen both as an agrarian clock for specific activities and as an \"exhibition\" of agricultural tools used by peasants.\n"
"\n"
"The SECOND component - more recent - corresponding to the Christianization of Romanian geographical space and repositioning in the sky the Christian and pre-Christian elements where constellations are associated with cosmogonical and theogonical myths, so that the sky is seen more like a church. \n"
"\n"
"And the THIRD component - the origin of the Romanian people, projecting on the sky the synthesis of formation of this people (the conquest of Dacia by the Romans) through projection of dramatic scenes from this history of Dacians mixing with the Romans.\n"
"\n"
"__Note__: in Western Constellation Orion there are four Traditional Romanian Constellations that are overlapping.\n"
