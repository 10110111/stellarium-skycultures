"The belief that the stars could influence human destinies appears to not have\n"
"reached Egypt until the Ptolemaic period. The temple of Hathor at Denderah\n"
"dates from Ptolemaic times (probably the first century BCE) and features a\n"
"wonderful and huge symbolic map of the sky in Egyptian painting style.\n"
"\n"
"It provides two versions: a circular shaped one [#10] and a rectangularly shaped\n"
"one [#11]. The rectangular \"zodiac\" of Denderah shows a sequence of Egyptian\n"
"figures next to a set of symbolic stars indicating how many stars form each\n"
"constellations. The round \"zodiac\" organizes these figures as if they were\n"
"placed in the sky.\n"
"\n"
"![](dendera_zodiac.webp)\n"
"One of the first depictions of the Dendera \"zodiac\", produced by\n"
"engineer-archaeologists Prosper Jollois and Edouard Devilliers in the 19th\n"
"century. The large figure on the right is the Goddess of Heaven, Nut. First\n"
"published in: Description de l'Égypte Antiquités, v. 4 [#12]\n"
"{: .img_and_caption }\n"
"\n"
"These constellations deviate in naming and depiction from the typical Greek\n"
"style:\n"
"\n"
" * Cancer, the Crab, is represented by the Scarab Beetle.\n"
" * the Big Dipper is not called Bear but \"the Bull's Foreleg\" refering to the\n"
"Foreleg of God Seth, an ancient Egyptian constellation\n"
" * The figure of the Lion near the Scales (which is not the zodiacal Lion) is\n"
"the constellation Centaurus [#1].\n"
" * There are two Shooters: one human with two legs, one centaur-like with four\n"
"legs. The centaur-like shooter is Sagittarius from the (Babylonian) zodiac, the\n"
"human bow-shooter represents the two constellations \"Bow\" and \"Arrow\", located\n"
"in the modern constellation Canis Maior (the \"Arrow\" includes Sirius) [#4].\n"
"\n"
"Earlier constellations are more problematic, but some indications exist that\n"
"some modern zodiac signs are very ancient indeed [#2][#3][#4][#13], although\n"
"the constellations did change significantly over time [#3][#13][#4].\n"
"\n"
"The Egyptians recognized five planets and called them the \"stars that knew no\n"
"rest\" or (more ancient way) \"eyes of [god] Horus\". Their movement across the\n"
"heavens reminded the Egyptians of five gods sailing across the sky in their\n"
"solar barque (boat). The planet now known as Jupiter was called \"Horus Who\n"
"Limits the Two Lands\"; Mars was \"Horus of the Horizon\"; Mercury was \"Sebegu\",\n"
"associated with Set; Saturn was \"Horus the Bull of the Sky\"; and Venus was \"the\n"
"God of the Morning\" [#8]."
