# Sky culture description section in markdown format
msgid ""
"The names of the constellations of the native Siberian peoples and tribes is\n"
"poorly studied. Additonally, due to the large territory, the knowledge about\n"
"constellations is difficult to reconcile in a single integrated picture. In\n"
"this sky culture, only specific names and objects are marked which are typical\n"
"for whole of Siberia. There had been more in only certain areas of Siberia,\n"
"used by only a smaller group of people.\n"
"\n"
"### Milky Way\n"
"\n"
"The names of the Milky Way are quite numerous, but they can be distinguished\n"
"into two groups: (i) the names coming from the past (e.g., _Goose Road_) and\n"
"(ii) the name of a later periods (_Mamay Road_). The names of the later period\n"
"is are clearly influenced by the Mongol-Tatar invasion to Russia.\n"
"\n"
"### Pleiades\n"
"\n"
"The Pleiades have many names, even more than names for the Milky Way exist.\n"
"However, all of them in Siberia can be reduced to the notion for a star cluster\n"
"as a bird's nest. Among these names _Duck Nest_ is the most common.\n"
"\n"
"### Ursa Major\n"
"\n"
"In central Siberia, the name _Elk_ is used very often for this constellation\n"
"but in Eastern Siberia the name \"Bear\" is used more frequently.\n"
"\n"
"### Orion\n"
"\n"
"Of the constellation of Orion, Siberians usually use only three stars of the\n"
"belt: they are called _Kichigi_ (the Threshers). It is a typical image of the\n"
"threchers from north-eastern Russia that they stand in a row. In the European\n"
"part of Russia an asterism called _Kichigi_ usually hides the Ursa Major\n"
"constellation."
