## Introduction

The Inuit sky culture files available for Stellarium are an adaptation of John MacDonald's research in his book __The Arctic Sky: Inuit Astronomy, Star Lore and Legend__. While placements and specifics of Inuit constellations might differ from tribe to tribe, the information in Stellarium presents the constellations and general themes of the arctic universe.

## Description

This sky culture was contributed by _Karrie Berglund_ of Digitalis Education Solutions, Inc. based primarily on the book __The Arctic Sky: Inuit Astronomy, Star Lore and Legend__ by John MacDonald.
