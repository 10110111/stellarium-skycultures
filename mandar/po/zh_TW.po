"This sky culture has 6 constellation line figures, names for 3 other identified\n"
"sky objects (the Pleiades, the Milky Way, and Venus), and the name of an\n"
"unidentified sky object. The constellations reflect the seafaring tradition.\n"
"\n"
"This sky culture for Stellarium is a transcript of data collected through\n"
"interviews with retired fishermen[#1].\n"
"\n"
"The Bugis sky culture is related (they are neighbouring ethnic groups on the\n"
"island of Sulawesi) so it is similar.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations and star names\n"
"\n"
"`Slanted House` (_Bittoéng Sapo Kepang_) is used as an indicator for the south. Five stars (including Crux) form a house with uneven foundations.\n"
"\n"
"`Widow` (_Bittoéng Tuwallu_) is a pair of stars just below the `Slanted House`, so also a sign for the south direction. Although one source[#1] doesn't link the two stars with a line, the equivalent Bugis data does[#2]. They are linked here.\n"
"\n"
"`Shark` (_Bittoéng Mangiwang_) is an asterism which marks the entry of the northwest monsoon season. There is a triangular fin in the middle, and a tail at the back. The drawing in one source[#1] has a large open mouth, but no star is identified for the back of the mouth, so none is included here (the mouth is closed). \n"
"\n"
"`Stingray` (_Bittoéng Lambaru_) also marks the entry of the northwest monsoon season. There is a head (with two eyes, which are not linked by lines to the head) and a tail.\n"
"\n"
"`Fishing Net` (_Bittoéng Panjala_) is used as an indicator of the entry of the cool season (between the two monsoons) and the appearance of the bambang fish. It consists of fishermen and a boat.\n"
"\n"
"`Group of Three Stars` (_Bittoéng Tallu-tallu_) are two groups of stars that each have three stars in line. These stars are a mark towards the east from the Pleiades. The stars are not linked into lines in one source[#1], but are linked here, since they're described as being \"in line\".\n"
"\n"
"The Pleiades (_Bittoéng Malunus_, which has no special meaning) are used as a sign of increasing number of flying fish in the Makassar Strait during the southeast monsoon season. \n"
"\n"
"### Planets\n"
"\n"
"Venus is `Pig` (_Bittoéng Bawi_). This star is used by mountain people as a mark that pigs will come out looking for food. \n"
"\n"
"Venus is also called `Star Carrying the Sun` (_Bittoéng Pambawa Allo_). It is a sign that the Sun will rise about an hour later.\n"
"\n"
"### Other sky objects\n"
"\n"
"An unidentified sky object called `Star of Fishermen` (_Bittoéng Pambosei_) is a marker towards the north. This star  usually appears in February, during the northwest monsoon season.\n"
"\n"
"`Dragon` (_Bittoéng Naga_) is the Milky Way. It is used by fishermen to find a good fishing location. It usually rises in the southeast, and when it disappears, fishermen are afraid that strong winds will appear."

"這種天空文化有 6 個星座線圖形、其他 3 個已識別的天體（昴宿星、銀河系和金星）的名稱，以及一個未識別的天體的名稱。星座反映了航海傳統。\n"
"\n"
"Stellarium 的這種天空文化是通過採訪退休漁民[#1] 收集的數據的抄本。\n"
"\n"
"武吉士天空文化是相關的（他們是蘇拉威西島上的鄰近民族），所以它是相似的。\n"
"\n"
"### 星座和星名\n"
"\n"
"`Slanted House` (Bittoéng Sapo Kepang) 被用作南方的指標。五顆星（包括Crux）形成了一個地基不平坦的房子。\n"
"\n"
"“寡婦”（Bittoéng Tuwallu）是“斜屋”正下方的一對星星，因此也是南向的標誌。雖然一個來源[#1] 沒有用一條線將兩顆星連接起來，但等效的武吉士數據卻有[#2]。它們鏈接在這裡。\n"
"\n"
"“鯊魚”（Bittoéng Mangiwang）是一個星號，標誌著西北季風季節的進入。中間有一個三角鰭，後面有一條尾巴。一個來源[#1] 中的繪圖有一個大的張開的嘴，但嘴後部沒有識別出星星，所以這裡沒有包括（嘴是閉合的）。\n"
"\n"
"“黃貂魚”（Bittoéng Lambaru）也標誌著西北季風季節的進入。有一個頭（有兩隻眼睛，與頭沒有線相連）和一條尾巴。\n"
"\n"
"`漁網`（Bittoéng Panjala）被用作涼爽季節（兩個季風之間）進入和班邦魚出現的指標。它由漁民和一艘船組成。\n"
"\n"
"“三顆星”（Bittoéng Tallu-tallu）是兩組恆星，每組都有三顆星。這些星星是昴星團向東的標誌。星星沒有在一個來源[#1] 中鏈接成線，但在這裡鏈接，因為它們被描述為“在線”。\n"
"\n"
"昴宿星團（Bittoéng Malunus，沒有特殊含義）被用作東南季風季節期間望加錫海峽飛魚數量增加的標誌。\n"
"\n"
"### 行星\n"
"\n"
"金星是“豬”（Bittoéng Bawi）。這顆星被山人用來作為豬出來覓食的標誌。\n"
"\n"
"金星也被稱為“承載太陽的星”（Bittoéng Pambawa Allo）。這是太陽將在一個小時後升起的跡象。\n"
"\n"
"### 其他天空物體\n"
"\n"
"一個名為“漁民之星”（Bittoéng Pambosei）的不明天空物體是向北的標誌。這顆星通常出現在二月的西北季風季節。\n"
"\n"
"`Dragon` (Bittoéng Naga) 是銀河系。漁民用它來尋找一個好的釣魚地點。它通常在東南方升起，當它消失時，漁民們害怕會出現強風。"
