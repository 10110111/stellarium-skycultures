msgid ""
"This sky culture has 6 constellation line figures, names for 3 other identified\n"
"sky objects (the Pleiades, the Milky Way, and Venus), and the name of an\n"
"unidentified sky object. The constellations reflect the seafaring tradition.\n"
"\n"
"This sky culture for Stellarium is a transcript of data collected through\n"
"interviews with retired fishermen[#1].\n"
"\n"
"The Bugis sky culture is related (they are neighbouring ethnic groups on the\n"
"island of Sulawesi) so it is similar.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations and star names\n"
"\n"
"`Slanted House` (_Bittoéng Sapo Kepang_) is used as an indicator for the south. Five stars (including Crux) form a house with uneven foundations.\n"
"\n"
"`Widow` (_Bittoéng Tuwallu_) is a pair of stars just below the `Slanted House`, so also a sign for the south direction. Although one source[#1] doesn't link the two stars with a line, the equivalent Bugis data does[#2]. They are linked here.\n"
"\n"
"`Shark` (_Bittoéng Mangiwang_) is an asterism which marks the entry of the northwest monsoon season. There is a triangular fin in the middle, and a tail at the back. The drawing in one source[#1] has a large open mouth, but no star is identified for the back of the mouth, so none is included here (the mouth is closed). \n"
"\n"
"`Stingray` (_Bittoéng Lambaru_) also marks the entry of the northwest monsoon season. There is a head (with two eyes, which are not linked by lines to the head) and a tail.\n"
"\n"
"`Fishing Net` (_Bittoéng Panjala_) is used as an indicator of the entry of the cool season (between the two monsoons) and the appearance of the bambang fish. It consists of fishermen and a boat.\n"
"\n"
"`Group of Three Stars` (_Bittoéng Tallu-tallu_) are two groups of stars that each have three stars in line. These stars are a mark towards the east from the Pleiades. The stars are not linked into lines in one source[#1], but are linked here, since they're described as being \"in line\".\n"
"\n"
"The Pleiades (_Bittoéng Malunus_, which has no special meaning) are used as a sign of increasing number of flying fish in the Makassar Strait during the southeast monsoon season. \n"
"\n"
"### Planets\n"
"\n"
"Venus is `Pig` (_Bittoéng Bawi_). This star is used by mountain people as a mark that pigs will come out looking for food. \n"
"\n"
"Venus is also called `Star Carrying the Sun` (_Bittoéng Pambawa Allo_). It is a sign that the Sun will rise about an hour later.\n"
"\n"
"### Other sky objects\n"
"\n"
"An unidentified sky object called `Star of Fishermen` (_Bittoéng Pambosei_) is a marker towards the north. This star  usually appears in February, during the northwest monsoon season.\n"
"\n"
"`Dragon` (_Bittoéng Naga_) is the Milky Way. It is used by fishermen to find a good fishing location. It usually rises in the southeast, and when it disappears, fishermen are afraid that strong winds will appear."

"这种天空文化有 6 个星座线图形、其他 3 个已识别的天体（昴宿星、银河系和金星）的名称，以及一个未识别的天体的名称。星座反映了航海传统。\n"
"\n"
"Stellarium 的这种天空文化是通过采访退休渔民[#1] 收集的数据的抄本。\n"
"\n"
"武吉士天空文化是相关的（他们是苏拉威西岛上的邻近民族），所以它是相似的。\n"
"\n"
"### 星座和星名\n"
"\n"
"`Slanted House` (Bittoéng Sapo Kepang) 被用作南方的指标。五颗星（包括Crux）形成了一个地基不平坦的房子。\n"
"\n"
"“寡妇”（Bittoéng Tuwallu）是“斜屋”正下方的一对星星，因此也是南向的标志。虽然一个来源[#1] 没有用一条线将两颗星连接起来，但等效的武吉士数据却有[#2]。它们链接在这里。\n"
"\n"
"“鲨鱼”（Bittoéng Mangiwang）是一个星号，标志着西北季风季节的进入。中间有一个三角鳍，后面有一条尾巴。一个来源[#1] 中的绘图有一个大的张开的嘴，但嘴后部没有识别出星星，所以这里没有包括（嘴是闭合的）。\n"
"\n"
"“黄貂鱼”（Bittoéng Lambaru）也标志着西北季风季节的进入。有一个头（有两只眼睛，与头没有线相连）和一条尾巴。\n"
"\n"
"`渔网`（Bittoéng Panjala）被用作凉爽季节（两个季风之间）进入和班邦鱼出现的指标。它由渔民和一艘船组成。\n"
"\n"
"“三颗星”（Bittoéng Tallu-tallu）是两组恒星，每组都有三颗星。这些星星是昴星团向东的标志。星星没有在一个来源[#1] 中链接成线，但在这里链接，因为它们被描述为“在线”。\n"
"\n"
"昴宿星团（Bittoéng Malunus，没有特殊含义）被用作东南季风季节期间望加锡海峡飞鱼数量增加的标志。\n"
"\n"
"### 行星\n"
"\n"
"金星是“猪”（Bittoéng Bawi）。这颗星被山人用来作为猪出来觅食的标志。\n"
"\n"
"金星也被称为“承载太阳的星”（Bittoéng Pambawa Allo）。这是太阳将在一个小时后升起的迹象。\n"
"\n"
"### 其他天空物体\n"
"\n"
"一个名为“渔民之星”（Bittoéng Pambosei）的不明天空物体是向北的标志。这颗星通常出现在二月的西北季风季节。\n"
"\n"
"`Dragon` (Bittoéng Naga) 是银河系。渔民用它来寻找一个好的钓鱼地点。它通常在东南方升起，当它消失时，渔民们害怕会出现强风。"
