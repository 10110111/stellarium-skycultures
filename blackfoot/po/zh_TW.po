"This sky culture has 4 constellation line figures, and names for the Milky Way,\n"
"the Pleiades, the Orion Nebula, three planets and three stars.\n"
"\n"
"According to the sources, the Blackfoot often featured the Big Dipper, the\n"
"Pleiades, and the Morning Star on their tipis, and believe that \"when people\n"
"die, their spirits go into the sky and become stars, thus ever increasing the\n"
"number of stars in the heavens\".\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations and star names\n"
"\n"
"The constellation `Seven Brothers and Their Sister` (identified with the\n"
"Western Big Dipper) represents siblings who escape to the sky when being chased\n"
"by a bear. The sister is the small star Alcor in one version. This is the\n"
"version written here: the source doesn't explicitly provide the constellation\n"
"lines, but identifies it with the modern Big Dipper, as a bowl with a handle,\n"
"so Alcor is not connected by a line, but is part of the constellation. Two\n"
"stars are named: the `Little Sister`, also named as `Sinopa` (translated\n"
"`Kit-Fox`)[#3], and \"the star at the end of the handle is often called\n"
"`Last Brother`\" [#1]. This constellation was used for time-keeping before the\n"
"introduction of clocks.\n"
"\n"
"In a second version of this constellation, the youngest brother becomes the\n"
"North Star, and the sister (who used to carry him) is the pointer star at the\n"
"lip of the bowl.\n"
"\n"
"The two main stars in Gemini (Castor and Pollux) are `Ashes-Chief and\n"
"Stuck-Behind`, twins whose story explains how a particular tipi design came\n"
"into use.\n"
"\n"
"The `Lodge of the Spider Man` is the brightest six stars of the Western\n"
"Northern Crown, representing the stones laid in a circle which used to hold\n"
"down a tipi. The `Spider Man's Fingers` is a possible configuration of stars in\n"
"Hercules[#1], so its structure is uncertain; they would represent five\n"
"fingers spinning a thread to let the legendary Feather Woman (native name:\n"
"So-at-sa-ki) down from the sky (\"the five bright stars just beyond [the\n"
"Northern Crown] in the constellation of Hercules are his five fingers\" [#3]).\n"
"\n"
"The six stars of the Pleiades (called `Lost Children` or `Bunched Stars`)\n"
"represent six poor children and have an associated story which explains why\n"
"they are visible in the evening sky only from fall to spring, but not the rest\n"
"of the year.\n"
"\n"
"A constellation called `Hand in the Sky` has been documented, but not\n"
"identified (so is not in this dataset). It could be another name for the\n"
"`Spider Man's Fingers`, or another constellation entirely. An associated story\n"
"also explains a particular tipi design.\n"
"\n"
"The North Star is called the `Star that Stands Still` (the other stars walk\n"
"around it).\n"
"\n"
"### Planets\n"
"\n"
"Jupiter is known as `Young Morning Star`, representing a boy, `Poïa`. Venus is\n"
"known as `Morning Star`, the boy's father. A story explains that they sometimes\n"
"travel together, but they may also travel apart for many years. At the time\n"
"when this story was documented (in July 1905), they were in conjunction. The\n"
"names for Mars are not explained in the source.\n"
"\n"
"### Other sky objects\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is called the `Wolf Trail`, which represents the shortest path\n"
"from the sky to the earth. The Orion Nebula is the stone knife of the mythical\n"
"person `Blood-Clot`, \"a culture hero who rids the world of evil\" [#1], and is\n"
"also called `Smoking-Star`."

"這種天空文化有 4 個星座線圖形，以及銀河系、昴宿星團、獵戶星雲、三顆行星和三顆恆星的名稱。\n"
"\n"
"據消息人士透露，黑腳人經常將北斗七星、昴宿星和晨星放在他們的腳尖上，並相信“人死後，他們的靈魂會升入天空，變成星星，因此星星的數量會不斷增加。天堂”。\n"
"\n"
"### 星座和星名\n"
"\n"
"七兄弟和他們的姐妹星座（與北斗七星同名）代表被熊追趕而逃到天空的兄弟姐妹。姐姐是一個版本中的小明星阿爾科。這是這裡寫的版本：來源沒有明確提供星座線，但將其與現代北斗七星標識為帶把手的碗，因此 Alcor 不是由線連接，而是星座的一部分。兩顆星被命名為：“小妹妹”，也叫“Sinopa”（譯\n"
"`Kit-Fox`)[#3]，而“句柄末端的星號常被稱為\n"
"`Last Brother`\" [#1]。這個星座在引入時鐘之前用於計時。\n"
"\n"
"在這個星座的第二個版本中，最小的兄弟成為北極星，而姐姐（曾經攜帶他）是碗口的指針星。\n"
"\n"
"雙子座中的兩個主要明星（Castor 和 Pollux）是“Ashes-Chief 和 Stuck-Behind”，這對雙胞胎的故事解釋了特定的 Tipi 設計是如何開始使用的。\n"
"\n"
"“蜘蛛俠小屋”是西北部皇冠上最亮的六顆星，代表著圓形的石頭，用來壓住一頂帳篷。 `蜘蛛俠的手指`是大力神[#1]中恆星的可能構型，因此其結構不確定；他們將代表五個手指旋轉一根線，讓傳說中的羽女（本名：So-at-sa-ki）從天上掉下來（“大力神星座[北皇冠]之外的五顆明亮的星星是他的五個手指”[#3]）。\n"
"\n"
"昴星團的六顆星（稱為“迷路的孩子”或“群星”）代表六個可憐的孩子，並有一個相關的故事，解釋了為什麼他們只在秋季到春季出現在傍晚的天空中，而一年中的其餘時間則看不到.\n"
"\n"
"一個名為“天空之手”的星座已被記錄在案，但尚未確定（因此不在此數據集中）。它可能是另一個名字\n"
"“蜘蛛俠的手指”，或者完全是另一個星座。一個相關的故事還解釋了一個特定的 Tipi 設計。\n"
"\n"
"北極星被稱為“靜止之星”（其他星星繞著它走）。\n"
"\n"
"### 行星\n"
"\n"
"木星被稱為“年輕的晨星”，代表一個男孩，“Poïa”。金星被稱為“晨星”，是男孩的父親。一個故事解釋說，他們有時會一起旅行，但也可能會分開很多年。在記錄這個故事的時候（1905 年 7 月），它們是結合在一起的。來源中沒有解釋火星的名稱。\n"
"\n"
"### 其他天空物體\n"
"\n"
"銀河係被稱為“狼徑”，它代表了從天空到地球的最短路徑。獵戶星雲是神話人物‘血凝塊’的石刀，“消除世界邪惡的文化英雄”[#1]，也被稱為‘吸煙之星’。"
