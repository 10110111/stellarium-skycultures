"This sky culture has 4 constellation line figures, and names for the Milky Way,\n"
"the Pleiades, the Orion Nebula, three planets and three stars.\n"
"\n"
"According to the sources, the Blackfoot often featured the Big Dipper, the\n"
"Pleiades, and the Morning Star on their tipis, and believe that \"when people\n"
"die, their spirits go into the sky and become stars, thus ever increasing the\n"
"number of stars in the heavens\".\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations and star names\n"
"\n"
"The constellation `Seven Brothers and Their Sister` (identified with the\n"
"Western Big Dipper) represents siblings who escape to the sky when being chased\n"
"by a bear. The sister is the small star Alcor in one version. This is the\n"
"version written here: the source doesn't explicitly provide the constellation\n"
"lines, but identifies it with the modern Big Dipper, as a bowl with a handle,\n"
"so Alcor is not connected by a line, but is part of the constellation. Two\n"
"stars are named: the `Little Sister`, also named as `Sinopa` (translated\n"
"`Kit-Fox`)[#3], and \"the star at the end of the handle is often called\n"
"`Last Brother`\" [#1]. This constellation was used for time-keeping before the\n"
"introduction of clocks.\n"
"\n"
"In a second version of this constellation, the youngest brother becomes the\n"
"North Star, and the sister (who used to carry him) is the pointer star at the\n"
"lip of the bowl.\n"
"\n"
"The two main stars in Gemini (Castor and Pollux) are `Ashes-Chief and\n"
"Stuck-Behind`, twins whose story explains how a particular tipi design came\n"
"into use.\n"
"\n"
"The `Lodge of the Spider Man` is the brightest six stars of the Western\n"
"Northern Crown, representing the stones laid in a circle which used to hold\n"
"down a tipi. The `Spider Man's Fingers` is a possible configuration of stars in\n"
"Hercules[#1], so its structure is uncertain; they would represent five\n"
"fingers spinning a thread to let the legendary Feather Woman (native name:\n"
"So-at-sa-ki) down from the sky (\"the five bright stars just beyond [the\n"
"Northern Crown] in the constellation of Hercules are his five fingers\" [#3]).\n"
"\n"
"The six stars of the Pleiades (called `Lost Children` or `Bunched Stars`)\n"
"represent six poor children and have an associated story which explains why\n"
"they are visible in the evening sky only from fall to spring, but not the rest\n"
"of the year.\n"
"\n"
"A constellation called `Hand in the Sky` has been documented, but not\n"
"identified (so is not in this dataset). It could be another name for the\n"
"`Spider Man's Fingers`, or another constellation entirely. An associated story\n"
"also explains a particular tipi design.\n"
"\n"
"The North Star is called the `Star that Stands Still` (the other stars walk\n"
"around it).\n"
"\n"
"### Planets\n"
"\n"
"Jupiter is known as `Young Morning Star`, representing a boy, `Poïa`. Venus is\n"
"known as `Morning Star`, the boy's father. A story explains that they sometimes\n"
"travel together, but they may also travel apart for many years. At the time\n"
"when this story was documented (in July 1905), they were in conjunction. The\n"
"names for Mars are not explained in the source.\n"
"\n"
"### Other sky objects\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is called the `Wolf Trail`, which represents the shortest path\n"
"from the sky to the earth. The Orion Nebula is the stone knife of the mythical\n"
"person `Blood-Clot`, \"a culture hero who rids the world of evil\" [#1], and is\n"
"also called `Smoking-Star`."

"这种天空文化有 4 个星座线图形，以及银河系、昴宿星团、猎户星云、三颗行星和三颗恒星的名称。\n"
"\n"
"据消息人士透露，黑脚人经常将北斗七星、昴宿星和晨星放在他们的脚尖上，并相信“人死后，他们的灵魂会升入天空，变成星星，因此星星的数量会不断增加。天堂”。\n"
"\n"
"### 星座和星名\n"
"\n"
"七兄弟和他们的姐妹星座（与北斗七星同名）代表被熊追赶而逃到天空的兄弟姐妹。姐姐是一个版本中的小明星阿尔科。这是这里写的版本：来源没有明确提供星座线，但将其与现代北斗七星标识为带把手的碗，因此 Alcor 不是由线连接，而是星座的一部分。两颗星被命名为：“小妹妹”，也叫“Sinopa”（译\n"
"`Kit-Fox`)[#3]，而“句柄末端的星号常被称为\n"
"`Last Brother`\" [#1]。这个星座在引入时钟之前用于计时。\n"
"\n"
"在这个星座的第二个版本中，最小的兄弟成为北极星，而姐姐（曾经携带他）是碗口的指针星。\n"
"\n"
"双子座中的两个主要明星（Castor 和 Pollux）是“Ashes-Chief 和 Stuck-Behind”，这对双胞胎的故事解释了特定的 Tipi 设计是如何开始使用的。\n"
"\n"
"“蜘蛛侠小屋”是西北部皇冠上最亮的六颗星，代表着圆形的石头，用来压住一顶帐篷。 `蜘蛛侠的手指`是大力神[#1]中恒星的可能构型，因此其结构不确定；他们将代表五个手指旋转一根线，让传说中的羽女（本名：So-at-sa-ki）从天上掉下来（“大力神星座[北皇冠]之外的五颗明亮的星星是他的五个手指”[#3]）。\n"
"\n"
"昴星团的六颗星（称为“迷路的孩子”或“群星”）代表六个可怜的孩子，并有一个相关的故事，解释了为什么他们只在秋季到春季出现在傍晚的天空中，而一年中的其余时间则看不到.\n"
"\n"
"一个名为“天空之手”的星座已被记录在案，但尚未确定（因此不在此数据集中）。它可能是另一个名字\n"
"“蜘蛛侠的手指”，或者完全是另一个星座。一个相关的故事还解释了一个特定的 Tipi 设计。\n"
"\n"
"北极星被称为“静止之星”（其他星星绕着它走）。\n"
"\n"
"### 行星\n"
"\n"
"木星被称为“年轻的晨星”，代表一个男孩，“Poïa”。金星被称为“晨星”，是男孩的父亲。一个故事解释说，他们有时会一起旅行，但也可能会分开很多年。在记录这个故事的时候（1905 年 7 月），它们是结合在一起的。来源中没有解释火星的名称。\n"
"\n"
"### 其他天空物体\n"
"\n"
"银河系被称为“狼径”，它代表了从天空到地球的最短路径。猎户星云是神话人物‘血凝块’的石刀，“消除世界邪恶的文化英雄”[#1]，也被称为‘吸烟之星’。"
