" the asterisms as well as the division of the path of the Moon into 28 "
"\"stations\" (lunar mansions) as a frame of reference in right ascension."

"Most astronomical observation in Japan until the Meiji Restoration was closely tied to astrological purposes. For ancient Chinese and later Korean and Japanese cartographers four seasons and four cardinal directions are marked as four talismanic animals - the Azure Dragon of the East (Spring), the Red Bird of the South (Summer), the White Tiger of the West (Fall), and the \"Genbu\" (Black Tortoise) of the North (Winter). Corresponding to each of the talismanic animals the celestial \"palaces\" were seven _sei shuku_ or what are sometimes called \"lunar lodges\" or lunar mansions or lunar houses. The lunar stations probably might be used to determine position of Sun and planets as well as the Moon, and their number may or may not have been related to the period of the moon's orbit. Origins of these associations are obscure and even controversial.\n"
"\n"
"Determination of the talismanic animals and associated star \"palaces\" together with the associated 28 _sei shuku_ or lunar lodges represent some of the most complex aspects of Asian \"astronomy\". An apparent anomaly is the fact that the actual positional path of the sun seems to move in a direction opposite the seasonal associations of spring and fall. Some scientists argue that this is due to the animals and _sei shuku_ being created some 17 to 18 millennia ago (precession creating the anomaly), but it does not really explain the apparent \"backward\" motion of the Sun through seasons.\n"
"\n"
"According to some scientists, the talismanic animals with their associated _sei shuku_ were probably used in conjunction with the direction to which the handle of the Big Dipper (often called the \"Northern Seven Stars\" or \"Northern Dipper\" in China, Korea, and Japan) pointed at the equinoxes and solstices. Before the Christian Era, when the _sei shuku_ were created, the Big Dipper did not appear to set, because they had a relatively \"higher\" position than now. \n"
"\n"
"Like myths and traditions in western cultures, these views still wield influence in the daily life of people in China, Korea, and Japan (despite quite prominent scientific literacy). However, it should be pointed out that astrological divination in China, Korea and Japan was and is rather complex.\n"
"\n"
"The lore related to lunar mansions is one of the most interesting aspects of Asian ethnoastronomy. Japanese interpretations of these associations tended to revolve around agricultural needs and animistic views of nature. Unlike many western myths and traditions, Japanese gods in the similitude of the talismanic animals can be seen as manifestations of nature.\n"

"在日本，直到明治維新之前，大多數天文觀測都與占星術密切相關。對於古代中國人以及後來的韓國和日本製圖師，四個季節和四個主要方向被標記為四種護符動物-東方的天藍色龍（春季），南方的紅鳥（夏季），西方的白老虎（秋季） ），以及北部（冬季）的“ Genbu”（黑龜）。與每種護符動物相對應的是，天上的“宮殿”是七個精工，或者有時被稱為“月球小屋”，月球大廈或月球屋。月球站可能被用來確定太陽和行星以及月球的位置，它們的數量可能與月球軌道的周期無關，也可能與月球的周期無關。這些協會的起源是模糊的，甚至是有爭議的。\n"
"\n"
"確定護符動物和相關的恆星“宮殿”以及相關的28個“ sei shuku_”或“月球小屋”代表了亞洲“天文學”最複雜的方面。一個明顯的異常現像是，太陽的實際位置路徑似乎在與春季和秋季的季節關聯相反的方向上移動。一些科學家認為，這是由於動物和sei shuku_在大約17至18千年前被創造出來的（進動造成了異常），但這並不能真正解釋太陽在整個季節中明顯的“向後”運動。\n"
"\n"
"一些科學家認為，護符動物及其相關的“ sei shuku_”可能與北斗七星（在中國，韓國和日本通常稱為“北七星”或“北斗七星”）的手柄方向結合使用。 ）指向晝夜平分線和至高點。在基督教時代之前，創建“ sei shuku”時，北斗七星似乎並沒有成立，因為它們比現在具有相對“更高”的地位。\n"
"\n"
"像西方文化中的神話和傳統一樣，這些觀點仍然在中國，韓國和日本的人們的日常生活中產生影響（儘管科學素養非常突出）。但是，應該指出的是，中國，韓國和日本的占星術曾經而且相當複雜。\n"
"\n"
"與月球大廈有關的知識是亞洲民族天文學最有趣的方面之一。日本對這些協會的解釋傾向於圍繞農業需求和萬物有靈論的自然觀。與許多西方神話和傳統不同，日本神靈在護身符動物的相似性中可以被視為自然的體現。\n"
