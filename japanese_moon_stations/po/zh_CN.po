"Most astronomical observation in Japan until the Meiji Restoration was closely\n"
"tied to astrological purposes. For ancient Chinese and later Korean and\n"
"Japanese cartographers four seasons and four cardinal directions are marked as\n"
"four talismanic animals - the Azure Dragon of the East (Spring), the Red Bird\n"
"of the South (Summer), the White Tiger of the West (Fall), and the \"Genbu\"\n"
"(Black Tortoise) of the North (Winter). Corresponding to each of the talismanic\n"
"animals the celestial \"palaces\" were seven _sei shuku_ or what are sometimes\n"
"called \"lunar lodges\" or lunar mansions or lunar houses. The lunar stations\n"
"probably might be used to determine position of Sun and planets as well as the\n"
"Moon, and their number may or may not have been related to the period of the\n"
"moon's orbit. Origins of these associations are obscure and even controversial.\n"
"\n"
"Determination of the talismanic animals and associated star \"palaces\" together\n"
"with the associated 28 _sei shuku_ or lunar lodges represent some of the most\n"
"complex aspects of Asian \"astronomy\". An apparent anomaly is the fact that the\n"
"actual positional path of the sun seems to move in a direction opposite the\n"
"seasonal associations of spring and fall. Some scientists argue that this is\n"
"due to the animals and _sei shuku_ being created some 17 to 18 millennia ago\n"
"(precession creating the anomaly), but it does not really explain the apparent\n"
"\"backward\" motion of the Sun through seasons.\n"
"\n"
"According to some scientists, the talismanic animals with their associated _sei\n"
"shuku_ were probably used in conjunction with the direction to which the handle\n"
"of the Big Dipper (often called the \"Northern Seven Stars\" or \"Northern Dipper\"\n"
"in China, Korea, and Japan) pointed at the equinoxes and solstices. Before the\n"
"Christian Era, when the _sei shuku_ were created, the Big Dipper did not appear\n"
"to set, because they had a relatively \"higher\" position than now.\n"
"\n"
"Like myths and traditions in western cultures, these views still wield\n"
"influence in the daily life of people in China, Korea, and Japan (despite quite\n"
"prominent scientific literacy). However, it should be pointed out that\n"
"astrological divination in China, Korea and Japan was and is rather complex.\n"
"\n"
"The lore related to lunar mansions is one of the most interesting aspects of\n"
"Asian ethnoastronomy. Japanese interpretations of these associations tended to\n"
"revolve around agricultural needs and animistic views of nature. Unlike many\n"
"western myths and traditions, Japanese gods in the similitude of the talismanic\n"
"animals can be seen as manifestations of nature.\n"

"在日本，直到明治维新之前，大多数天文观测都与占星术密切相关。对于古代中国人以及后来的韩国和日本制图师，四个季节和四个主要方向被标记为四种护符动物-东方的天蓝色龙（春季），南方的红鸟（夏季），西方的白老虎（秋季） ），以及北部（冬季）的“ Genbu”（黑龟）。与每种护符动物相对应的是，天体的“宫殿”是七个圣书屋或有时被称为“月球小屋”或月球大厦或月球屋。月球站可能被用来确定太阳和行星以及月球的位置，它们的数量可能与月球轨道的周期无关，也可能与月球的周期无关。这些协会的起源是模糊的，甚至是有争议的。\n"
"\n"
"确定护符动物和相关的恒星“宫殿”以及相关的28个sei shuku或月球小屋代表了亚洲“天文学”最复杂的方面。一个明显的异常现象是，太阳的实际位置路径似乎在与春季和秋季的季节性关联相反的方向上移动。一些科学家认为，这是由于动物和成虫在大约17至18千年前被创造出来的（进动造成了异常），但这并不能真正解释太阳在整个季节中明显的“向后”运动。\n"
"\n"
"根据一些科学家的说法，护符动物及其相关的sei shuku可能与北斗七星（在中国，韩国和日本通常称为“北七星”或“北斗七星”）的手柄方向结合使用。 ）指向昼夜平分线和至高点。在基督教时代之前，当建立圣书社时，北斗星号似乎并没有成立，因为它们比现在具有相对“较高”的地位。\n"
"\n"
"就像西方文化中的神话和传统一样，这些观点仍然在中国，韩国和日本的人们的日常生活中产生影响（尽管科学素养非常突出）。但是，应该指出的是，中国，韩国和日本的占星术曾经是而且相当复杂。\n"
"\n"
"与月球大厦有关的知识是亚洲民族天文学最有趣的方面之一。日本对这些协会的解释倾向于围绕农业需求和万物有灵论的自然观。与许多西方神话和传统不同，日本神灵在护符动物的相似性中可以被视为自然的体现。\n"
