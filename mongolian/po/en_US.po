"###  Constellations \n"
"\n"
" Generally, stars represent animals turning around the North Star whichis symbolized by the golden stick (_Altan Hadaas_). Almostall Mongolian asterisms are similar to those that we know. Howeversome have other names like _Num Sum_ (The Bow and the Arrow)for the constellation Swan, or _Doloon Burkhan_ for the sevenstars of the Big Dipper. The summer triangle made up of Vega, Deneband Altair stars refers to three stags (_Gurvan Maral Od_ inMongolian). And Cassiopeia represents, in the Mongolian imagination,the Five Stars Woman (_Hun Tavan Od_).\n"
"\n"
"###  Planets and Stars \n"
"\n"
" Originally, Tibeto-Mongolian astrology calculates the positions ofeach of the planets visible with the naked eye. Because planets beyondSaturn are not visible without telescope (the instrument whichappeared long time after the creation of their astrology), theMongolians have attributed one of the five planets for each day of theweek, completing with the Sun (_Nar_) for Sunday and the Moon(_Sar_) for Monday. The names of the Solar System's planets andPluto have some peculiarities in Mongolian. Mercury is named_Bud_ (associated with Wednesday), Venus, _Sugar_(associated with Friday), the Earth, _Delkhii_, Mars,_Angarag_ (associated with Tuesday), Jupiter,_Barhasbadi_ (associated with Thursday), Saturn,_Sanchir_ (associated with Saturday), Uranus,_Tengeriin-van_, Neptune, _Dalai-van_ and at last Pluto,_Dalkhii-van_. We can see that the three last, invisible to thenaked eye and discovered long time after the others, have thecharacteristic to have the particle _-van_ at the end of thename, indicating the princely status in Mongolian. Earth and Plutoare named similarly, except that this last one has this particle. Itis possible to translate from Mongolian Pluto like \"The princelyground\" (ground and not Earth because it means here the surface onwhich we walk, not the Earth. Uranus, _Tengeriin-van_, could betranslated as \"princely sky\", and Neptun, _Dalai-van_, as the\"princely ocean\". Nevertheless, this particle has no real equivalentin English, and translations above are presented to give an idea ofthe planets name's meaning. However, the names of the celestial bodiesspecified here come from Sanskrit (language spoken in India) and arelargely used in the current language in Mongolia but in an unofficialway. \n"
"\n"
" It is also very interesting to see the tight link between termsdesignating other celestial bodies and their beliefs: indeed,_Tengeriin Zadas_ appoints the Milky Way. We could literallytranslate this as the \"Sky Line\" (_Tengeriin_ for the sky,which also means the god of the sky, and _Zadas_ for theline). Well known in Mongolian star lore concerns Alcor, the starlocated above Mizar in the Big Bear. It symbolises the recover andprotection star. It was placed here by _Tengeriin_ (god ofheaven) to protect Mizar. To become an archer for Genghis Khan (13thcentury), it seemed that one had to be able to discern these two starswith the naked eye.\n"
"\n"
" From a historic point of view, this excellent knowledge of the skygoes back to _Ulug Beg_ (AD1394-1449; _Taraghay_ byhis real name), astronomer, mathematician and viceroy in Samarkandwhose empire spread as far as Central Asia. Turning away from hisroyal obligations, he examined celestial bodies and astronomicalquestions of his time. He is the first to extremely precisely measureSaturn's revolution period (_Sanchir_) with a sextant of 40meters radius. \n"
"\n"
"###  Myths and Legends \n"
"\n"
"#### The Great Bear\n"
"\n"
" Mongolians are particularly attached to the Great Bear. Thisconstellation is limited for them to the seven Dipper stars making the bear'stail and body, but the legend concerning it is probably the most famous inMongolia. \n"
"\n"
">  \n"
"> Once upon a time, there were eight orphan brothersgifted with outstanding capabilities living within a kingdom. The kingand the queen lived within it peacefully. One day, a monster came andkidnapped the queen. The king asked the eight brothers to bring herback and said: \"If one of you succeeds to rescue my beloved, I willgive to him a golden arrow\". The orphans went together to assist theirqueen. They searched the monster during two days and three nights,when in the middle of the third night, they found and killed themonster. They brought back the queen in the castle. \n"
"> \n"
"> The kingdid not cut out the arrow in eight parts, he decided to threw it inthe sky. The first to catch it could keep it. The younger brothersucceeded the test and changed immediately into the North Star (PolarStar). The seven others changed into the seven gods, the seven Buddhasvisiting their younger brother every night. The name _Doloonburkhan_ (the Seven Buddhas) come from this legend to appoint theGreat Bear and the Golden Stick, _Altan Hadaas_, the PolarStar.\n"
"> \n"
"\n"
" A tradition, particularly delightful, concerns the link betweenMongolian people and the Great Bear as one star of this constellation isattributed to each of them. It depends on their birth year in the Chinesecalendar. Chinese and Mongolian calendars have some similarities (theMongolian calendar is a lunar calendar). Each year issymbolized by an animal, itself associated to a star of theconstellation Great Bear. The first, Dubhe, corresponds to the rat's year, thesecond, Merak, corresponds to the ox and so on until the end ofthe Great Bear's tail where Alkaid symbolizes the year of the horse. Then wecome back to the first, the sheep year and we repeat the same wayuntil the twelfth and latest year of the Chinese calendar, the one of thepig. Therefore, the two stars at the end of the tail are assigned onetime only. \n"
"\n"
"\\[Note by G. Zotti: This is a variant of the old Seven Buddha Sutradescribed by _Elverskog_. There however, the association of thestars goes in an up-and-down movement, i.e., Dubhe/Rat, Merak/Ox,... Mizar/Snake, Alkaid/Horse, Mizar/Goat, ... Merak/Pig.\\]\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"#### Shooting stars\n"
"\n"
" Shooting stars have also a specific meaning: they are personifiedthrough their beliefs. When they see these shooting stars they imaginethat it is a star which falls from the sky and which symbolizes somebodywho just died. Whereas occidental people make a wish, Mongolians say:\"Phew, it is not me!\"\n"
"\n"
"#### Neglected Legends \n"
"\n"
" Three legends just as rich in meaning concern the Sun, eclipsesand _Hun Tavan Od_ (Cassiopeia). However, they are nowadaysneglected and almost forgotten by most Mongolians: \n"
"\n"
"##### Sun\n"
"\n"
">  \n"
">  At the origin of the world, there was only one man andvast particularly dry meadows, burned by the seven suns which lit theworld. This man, a very good archer, made the promise to the gods thathe pierced all these suns without missing a target even once. If heshould fail, he would cut himself all the fingers one by one and leaveto live in a hole like a marmot (groundhog) to ward off the curse thatwould weigh on him. He took his bow, pulled a first arrow and hit histarget. A second, a third until the sixth which destroyed the suns. Hefinished by pulling his seventh arrow towards the last sun, when aswallow flew off and passed through its direction. The bird washit. The man had not reach his goal, so he left towards exile in ahole, cut his fingers and turned into a marmot. The swallow had justsaved our Sun, otherwise all life would have disappeared from theworld's surface.\n"
"> \n"
"\n"
" We have to see here a parallel with the number seven, importantin the Mongolian culture like all odd numbers. They bring luck in thebuddhist religion.\n"
"\n"
"##### Eclipses\n"
"\n"
">   \n"
"> At that time lived a scary monster named _Raah_which frightened the entire world. He devoured all who were in itsway. The god _Orchiwaani_ owned a magic spring: whoever drankfrom it became immortal. One day, _Raah_ stole the spring anddrunk. The Moon and the Sun caught the monster in the act and reportedto _Orchiwaani_. Seething with rage to hear about this piece ofnews he went to fight the monster. He cut its head many times but itgrew again immediately because _Raah_ had become immortal. Hethought then to cut its tail in order to allow all that it ate toleave again directly. Just as _Orchiwaani_ would seize themonster to finish it off, it escaped and disappeared between the Moonand the Sun. Then _Orchiwaani_ asked the Moon, who recaptured_Raah_ and cut its rump and its tail. In revenge, the monstercomes back sometimes to eat the Moon or the Sun which exitimmediately, giving rise to moon and solar eclipses.\n"
"> \n"
"\n"
"When there is an eclipse, Mongolians know that it means that_Raah_ devours the Moon or the Sun and they make a lot of noiseso that the monster liberates the eclipsed star. In the 13th century,Guillaume de Rubruck wrote:\n"
"\n"
">  \n"
"> \"Some \\[Mongolian people\\] have knowledge in astronomyand predict them \\[to other Mongolian people\\] the Lunar and Solareclipses and, when it is about to produce one, everybody stocks up onfood because they do not pass the door of their habitation. And whilethe eclipse happened, they play the drum and instruments and do bignoise and clamors. When the eclipse is finished, they devotethemselves to beverage and festivity and do big party.\"\n"
"> \n"
"\n"
"(Source: _Les astres chez les Turcs et les Mongols_ by Jean-Paul Roux(French). _Revue de l'histoire des religions_, tome 195 n°2,1979. pp; 153-192.) \n"
"\n"
"Eclipse travelers in 2008 still witnessed drivers and cooks hidingin their tents and making noise with the pots. It seemed authentic,not a show for the tourists. Also note the similarity of _Raah_with Indian _Rahu_.\n"
"\n"
"##### Cassiopeia (_Hun Tavan Od_)\n"
"\n"
"Cassiopeia (_Hun Tavan Od_) symbolises unity, brotherhood,solidarity for the Mongolians. The constellation's five starsrepresent unity of the five children of Genghis Khan's wife,Oulin. \n"
"\n"
">  \n"
"> Them did not get well along with each other andsquabbled all the time. Their mother decided to strongly tie fiveropes, and each one should try to untie a knot. If they succeeded, itmeant that they didn't remain united with other, and that thebrotherhood didn't gather in hard times. Conversely, if the knotswithstood the test, the five brothers would remain united and closefor the rest of their lives and would be victorious at the time ofwars.\n"
"> \n"
"\n"
"####  Other Beliefs Linked to the Sky\n"
"\n"
"According to a Mongolian legend, a woman devoting herself to countone hundred stars in the sky will dream about her future husband.\n"
"\n"
" Sometimes, Mongolians honor the Great Bear (_Doloon Burkhan_)by throwing milk in its direction. Milk, of white color, symbolizes purity in Mongolia. They pray so that something may be fulfilled, but forseveral persons, not for just one person, because this would bring badluck. Milk can be replaced by vodka which, even if it is colorless,symbolizes the dark color and the strength for Mongolians. By doing this,it avoids bad luck, quarrels, fear and fends off evil spirits.\n"
"\n"
"###  Conclusion\n"
"\n"
" The constellations are inspired by occidental ones, but theMongolian cosmogony, briefly exposed here, highlights a notableidentity of beliefs which are associated with it. Mongolian cultureand knowledge transmission is essentially verbal, and so few writtentraces exist about these subjects. It is therefore particularly hardto relate their cosmogony with high fidelity and precision. In orderto preserve knowledge about this cosmogony, every observation,suggestions or collaboration are welcome!\n"
