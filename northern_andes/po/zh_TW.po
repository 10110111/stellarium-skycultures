"The Northern Andes in the South American subcontinent provide a human culture\n"
"with strong relations to the surrounding nature: They observed the sky through\n"
"nature \"mirrors\" (lakes of plain water level) and the changing trails of Sun,\n"
"Moon, and stars with the help of mountain shapes. This way, they determined the\n"
"calendar, knew when to seek rescueage from snow and ice or heat for themselves\n"

"南美次大陸的北安第斯山脈為人類文化與周圍的自然環境提供了緊密聯繫：他們藉助自然界的“鏡子”（平原水位湖）觀察了天空，並藉助太陽，月亮和恆星不斷變化的踪跡山的形狀。這樣，他們確定了日曆，知道什麼時候為自己或他們的動植物尋求從冰雪或高溫中解救出來的機會。"

"### Northern Andes\n"
"\n"
"The have a complex laboratory that teaches us about the different sciences that\n"
"humanity has contemplated in its history. Starting from observation to the\n"
"various elements that surround us, with the need to ensure our survival as a\n"
"species and lineage, the human being learned to understand the constantly\n"
"emitted signals of the cosmos: in plants, animals, the climate and other\n"
"elements. Then the wise learned to warn about the changes that affect living\n"
"beings.\n"
"\n"
"In order to replicate the ancestral measurements in the Andean observatories,\n"
"we propose the use of a wide-mouth container; in the open we will place it and\n"
"level properly. In order to create a star mirror, we will fill it with water.\n"
"In this reflection of the sky, the Andean sage can admire and record the\n"
"movements of the sun, the moon, planets or the stars.\n"
"\n"
"The Stellarium simulation allows us to recreate these \"cosmic mirrors\" and\n"
"analyze the specific stellar dynamics that are seen in the Northern Andes as\n"
"well as the millenarian wise men in their patient observation through the ages.\n"
"These beings have registered the cosmic movements in the current pre-hispanic\n"
"heritage of the Andean peoples. Additionally, they produced graphic\n"
"configurations, which after much joint work by several researchers in several\n"
"generations at the beginning of the 21st century have been partially decoded.\n"
"\n"
"Here we tell what we found in the equatorial skies:\n"
"\n"
"### The Sun (Punchao o Wilca)\n"
"\n"
"When we find ourselves in the center of the planet, the apparent movement that\n"
"the sun makes through our annual journey around it is equidistant and\n"
"proportional. At the equinoxes the sun will cross the center of the sky\n"
"(zenith), on the solstice of June it will travel its southernmost road (it will\n"
"go north) and on the solstice of December the northernmost path will be\n"
"traveled (more to the south). These natural phenomena are the marks of the four\n"
"main festivals that celebrate a specific part of the agricultural calendar\n"
"because they are the points of inflection between the climatic seasons.\n"
"\n"
"According to the colonial chronicler Juan de Betanzos \"the Indians knew the\n"
"leap years\"; thanks to the research of Gustavo Guayasamín, a cyclic movement is\n"
"identified in a four-year interval in the sun; to observe it, we suggest\n"
"placing ourselves at the March equinox (approximately the March equinoxes are\n"
"the 21st day in the Gregorian calendar), at the solar daytime (12:20 in the\n"
"civil time for the year 2018). We can then move forward in time thanks to the\n"
"\"Date / Time Window\" from year to year and we will notice that the sun moves,\n"
"returning to the point where the observation begins in periods of four years,\n"
"for example: It starts in 2016, moves to the left of the spectator in 2017,\n"
"continues moving to the left in 2018, also moves in 2019 and in 2020 returns to\n"
"its initial position; then start the cycle again.\n"
"\n"
"### Clear Constellations, Asterisms and Guidelines in the Andes.\n"
"\n"
"We consider that by means of \"stellar mirrors\" the sages could register the\n"
"stellar traffic; Through this observation they noticed that during the\n"
"nightfalls of each equinox and solstice, specific stars appear in the sky, as\n"
"if they were marking the climatic changes to which we are exposed, so these\n"
"cosmic signals were recorded in the Andean prehispanic patrimony giving rise to\n"
"the Andean geometrical forms.\n"
"\n"
"__March Equinox__\n"
"\n"
"*\"Antonio Quinatoa\" Cross:* At dusk the first stars to appear are: Sirius -\n"
"Procyon - Rigel - Betelgeuse, which form a square or the cross named \"Antonio\n"
"Quinatoa\". It is the constellation that governs the masculine cycle.\n"
"\n"
"__September Equinox__\n"
"\n"
"*Molestina Triangle:* The first stars to appear are: Altair - Vega - Antares\n"
"who make up the triangle named \"Molestina\".\n"
"\n"
"__Constellation Daniela Alejandra Ayala:__ Thanks to the hard work in the\n"
"registration of the designs, we have identified the clear constellation named\n"
"\"Daniela Alejandra Ayala\", a cosmic set that accompanies the image of the \"Mono\n"
"Andino\". It appears in the center of the sky at nightfall of the female\n"
"equinox.\n"
"\n"
"__June Solstice__\n"
"\n"
"__South Cross:__ The most outstanding stars in the evening of the Summer\n"
"Solstice for the Northern Hemisphere are: A Cruz, Mimosa, δ Crucis, ζ Crucis, λ\n"
"Crucis and μ Crucis who form the \"Southern Cross\".\n"
"\n"
"__December Solstice__\n"
"\n"
"__The “Jorge Trujillo” Arrow:__ The most outstanding stars in the evening of\n"
"the winter solstice for the southern hemisphere are Caph - Shedar - Navi - K\n"
"Cas, they are part of the western constellation of Cassiopeia, the resulting\n"
"form evokes the shape of an arrow that at the end of the December solstice. It\n"
"is in an East - West direction.\n"
"\n"
"The asterisms that we include are the first stars to appear at the end of each\n"
"equinox or solstice. Like the constellations, these basic forms (diamond,\n"
"square, triangle and arrow), mark the beginning or end of a cycle, apparently\n"
"human beings discovered and recorded them before the forms in the dark\n"
"constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### The Sacred Beings in the Cosmos. The Dark Constellations.\n"
"\n"
"#### The Milky Way\n"
"\n"
"Our planet belongs to the galaxy of the Milky Way, whose shape is that of a\n"
"large disk with two bulging arms; this form and the rotation of the earth means\n"
"that at the evenings of the equinoxes and solstices we can appreciate a\n"
"specific part of it, thus becoming a signal that the ancestors appreciated to\n"
"measure the times. Called in the Andes as the \"Muyun\" for many peoples, it\n"
"represents a gigantic life-giving serpent.\n"
"\n"
"Contrary to the West, the constellations are not made up of bright points or\n"
"stars; the astral beings are housed in the \"dark spots\" existing in the\n"
"brilliance of the Milky Way, so at each of the turning points in our annual\n"
"path around the sun (Solstices and Equinoxes), we will find a guiding\n"
"constellation in each \"visible end\" of the galaxy. As with lunar or solar\n"
"movements, the movements of the constellations in the Northern Andes marked the\n"
"beginning or end of specific eras, agricultural, civil, reproductive or\n"
"festive. They determined the fate of beings, receiving respect and veneration\n"
"for those who came for their wisdom; thus developing a religious thought\n"
"similar to that of the sun or the moon throughout the continent.\n"
"\n"
"Here we describe the constellations decoded to date:\n"
"\n"
"#### Dark Constellations\n"

"### 北安第斯山脈\n"
"\n"
"該實驗室有一個複雜的實驗室，可向我們傳授人類在其歷史中曾考慮過的各種科學。從觀察到圍繞我們的各種元素，到確保我們作為物種和宗族生存的需要，人類學會了了解不斷發出的宇宙信號：植物，動物，氣候和其他元素。然後，明智的人學會了警告那些影響生物的變化。\n"
"\n"
"為了在安第斯天文台中復制祖先的測量，我們建議使用寬口容器。在公開場合，我們將其放置並正確調平。為了創建一個星鏡，我們將其裝滿水。在天空的映照下，安第斯聖人可以欣賞並記錄太陽，月亮，行星或恆星的運動。\n"
"\n"
"恆星模擬使我們能夠重新創建這些“宇宙鏡”，並分析在整個安第斯山脈以及千禧年智者中觀察到的特定恆星動力學。這些人已經在安第斯民族目前的西班牙裔前遺產中記錄了宇宙運動。此外，他們還製作了圖形配置，經過21世紀初幾代研究人員在幾代人的共同努力下，這些圖形已部分解碼。\n"
"\n"
"在這裡，我們告訴我們在赤道天空中發現的東西：\n"
"\n"
"### 太陽（Punchao o Wilca）\n"
"\n"
"當我們發現自己位於行星的中心時，太陽在我們繞行星的年度旅行中所產生的明顯運動是等距且成比例的。在春分點，太陽將越過天空的中心（天頂），在冬至的時候太陽將走其最南端的道路（它將向北），在冬至的十二月中，將走過最北的路徑（向南更多） ）。這些自然現像是慶祝農業日曆特定部分的四個主要節日的標誌，因為它們是氣候季節之間的拐點。\n"
"\n"
"根據殖民地編年史家胡安·德·貝坦佐斯的說法，“印第安人知道the年”。由於古斯塔沃·瓜亞薩米（GustavoGuayasamín）的研究，在太陽的四年間隔中發現了周期性運動。為了觀察這一點，我們建議將自己置於三月春分點（大約三月春分點是公曆的第21天），也就是太陽日（2018年民用時間12:20）。然後，借助逐年的“日期/時間窗口”，我們可以及時前進，我們會注意到太陽在移動，返回到觀察開始於四年的時間點，例如：從2016年開始，在2017年移至觀眾的左側，在2018年繼續移至左側，在2019年也移至2020年，返回初始位置；然後重新開始循環。\n"
"\n"
"### 清除安第斯山脈中的星座，星空和準則。\n"
"\n"
"我們認為，聖人可以通過“星鏡”來記錄恆星的流量。通過觀察，他們注意到在每個春分和冬至的夜晚，特定的星星出現在天空中，好像它們標誌著我們所處的氣候變化一樣，因此這些宇宙信號被記錄在安第斯西班牙裔前世襲中，安第斯山脈的幾何形式。\n"
"\n"
"_三月春分\n"
"\n"
"*“ Antonio Quinatoa”十字架：*黃昏時出現的第一顆星是：Sirius-Procyon-Rigel-Betelgeuse，它們形成一個正方形或一個名為“ Antonio Quinatoa”的十字架。支配男性週期的是星座。\n"
"\n"
"_9月春分\n"
"\n"
"* Molestina三角：*最早出現的星星是：Altair-Vega-組成名為“ Molestina”的三角形的Antares。\n"
"\n"
"_星座Daniela Alejandra Ayala：感謝外觀設計的艱苦努力，我們確定了一個清晰的星座，名為“ Daniela Alejandra Ayala”，這是一個宇宙集，伴隨著“ Mono Andino”的形象。它出現在雌性春分的黃昏的天空中心。\n"
"\n"
"_六月至日\n"
"\n"
"_南十字星：北半球夏至之夜最傑出的恆星是：形成“南十字星”的克魯茲，含羞草，δ克魯西斯，ζ克魯西斯，λ克魯西斯和μ克魯西斯。\n"
"\n"
"_十二月至日\n"
"\n"
"_“豪爾赫·特魯希略”箭：南半球冬至之夜最傑出的恆星是Caph-Shedar-Navi-K Cas，它們是仙后座西部星座的一部分，其形成的形狀讓人聯想起箭頭表示在冬至結束時。它在東西向。\n"
"\n"
"我們所包括的星號是在每個春分或冬至末出現的第一批恆星。像星座一樣，這些基本形式（菱形，正方形，三角形和箭頭）標記著一個週期的開始或結束，顯然是人類在黑暗的星座中發現並記錄了它們。\n"
"\n"
"### 宇宙中的神聖生物。黑暗星座。\n"
"\n"
"#### 銀河\n"
"\n"
"我們的星球屬於銀河系，它的形狀是一個帶有兩個凸起臂的大圓盤。這種形式和地球的自轉意味著在春分和至高至晚的夜晚，我們可以欣賞到地球的特定部分，從而成為祖先欣賞測量時間的信號。在安第斯山脈被稱為許多民族的“牧雲”，它代表了巨大的賦予生命的蛇。\n"
"\n"
"與西方相反，星座不是由亮點或恆星組成；星體存在於銀河系光輝中存在的“暗點”中，因此，在我們繞太陽旋轉的年度路徑的每個轉折點（Solstices和Equinoxes），我們都會在每個“可見光”中找到一個引導星座。結束”。與月球或太陽運動一樣，安第斯山脈北部的星座運動標誌著農業，民間，生殖或喜慶特定時代的開始或結束。他們決定眾生的命運，為那些為了自己的智慧而來的人們表示敬意和崇敬。因此發展出一種宗教思想，類似於整個大陸的太陽或月亮。\n"
