"with strong relations to the surrounding nature: They observed the sky through\n"
"nature \"mirrors\" (lakes of plain water level) and the changing trails of Sun,\n"
"Moon, and stars with the help of mountain shapes. This way, they determined the\n"

"南美次大陆的北安第斯山脉为人类文化与周围的自然环境提供了紧密联系：他们借助自然界的“镜子”（平原水位湖）观察了天空，并借助太阳，月亮和恒星不断变化的踪迹山的形状。这样，他们确定了日历，知道什么时候为自己或他们的动植物寻求从冰雪或高温中寻求救助的机会。"

"### Northern Andes\n"
"\n"
"The have a complex laboratory that teaches us about the different sciences that\n"
"humanity has contemplated in its history. Starting from observation to the\n"
"various elements that surround us, with the need to ensure our survival as a\n"
"species and lineage, the human being learned to understand the constantly\n"
"emitted signals of the cosmos: in plants, animals, the climate and other\n"
"elements. Then the wise learned to warn about the changes that affect living\n"
"beings.\n"
"\n"
"In order to replicate the ancestral measurements in the Andean observatories,\n"
"we propose the use of a wide-mouth container; in the open we will place it and\n"
"level properly. In order to create a star mirror, we will fill it with water.\n"
"In this reflection of the sky, the Andean sage can admire and record the\n"
"movements of the sun, the moon, planets or the stars.\n"
"\n"
"The Stellarium simulation allows us to recreate these \"cosmic mirrors\" and\n"
"analyze the specific stellar dynamics that are seen in the Northern Andes as\n"
"well as the millenarian wise men in their patient observation through the ages.\n"
"These beings have registered the cosmic movements in the current pre-hispanic\n"
"heritage of the Andean peoples. Additionally, they produced graphic\n"
"configurations, which after much joint work by several researchers in several\n"
"generations at the beginning of the 21st century have been partially decoded.\n"
"\n"
"Here we tell what we found in the equatorial skies:\n"
"\n"
"### The Sun (Punchao o Wilca)\n"
"\n"
"When we find ourselves in the center of the planet, the apparent movement that\n"
"the sun makes through our annual journey around it is equidistant and\n"
"proportional. At the equinoxes the sun will cross the center of the sky\n"
"(zenith), on the solstice of June it will travel its southernmost road (it will\n"
"go north) and on the solstice of December the northernmost path will be\n"
"traveled (more to the south). These natural phenomena are the marks of the four\n"
"main festivals that celebrate a specific part of the agricultural calendar\n"
"because they are the points of inflection between the climatic seasons.\n"
"\n"
"According to the colonial chronicler Juan de Betanzos \"the Indians knew the\n"
"leap years\"; thanks to the research of Gustavo Guayasamín, a cyclic movement is\n"
"identified in a four-year interval in the sun; to observe it, we suggest\n"
"placing ourselves at the March equinox (approximately the March equinoxes are\n"
"the 21st day in the Gregorian calendar), at the solar daytime (12:20 in the\n"
"civil time for the year 2018). We can then move forward in time thanks to the\n"
"\"Date / Time Window\" from year to year and we will notice that the sun moves,\n"
"returning to the point where the observation begins in periods of four years,\n"
"for example: It starts in 2016, moves to the left of the spectator in 2017,\n"
"continues moving to the left in 2018, also moves in 2019 and in 2020 returns to\n"
"its initial position; then start the cycle again.\n"
"\n"
"### Clear Constellations, Asterisms and Guidelines in the Andes.\n"
"\n"
"We consider that by means of \"stellar mirrors\" the sages could register the\n"
"stellar traffic; Through this observation they noticed that during the\n"
"nightfalls of each equinox and solstice, specific stars appear in the sky, as\n"
"if they were marking the climatic changes to which we are exposed, so these\n"
"cosmic signals were recorded in the Andean prehispanic patrimony giving rise to\n"
"the Andean geometrical forms.\n"
"\n"
"__March Equinox__\n"
"\n"
"*\"Antonio Quinatoa\" Cross:* At dusk the first stars to appear are: Sirius -\n"
"Procyon - Rigel - Betelgeuse, which form a square or the cross named \"Antonio\n"
"Quinatoa\". It is the constellation that governs the masculine cycle.\n"
"\n"
"__September Equinox__\n"
"\n"
"*Molestina Triangle:* The first stars to appear are: Altair - Vega - Antares\n"
"who make up the triangle named \"Molestina\".\n"
"\n"
"__Constellation Daniela Alejandra Ayala:__ Thanks to the hard work in the\n"
"registration of the designs, we have identified the clear constellation named\n"
"\"Daniela Alejandra Ayala\", a cosmic set that accompanies the image of the \"Mono\n"
"Andino\". It appears in the center of the sky at nightfall of the female\n"
"equinox.\n"
"\n"
"__June Solstice__\n"
"\n"
"__South Cross:__ The most outstanding stars in the evening of the Summer\n"
"Solstice for the Northern Hemisphere are: A Cruz, Mimosa, δ Crucis, ζ Crucis, λ\n"
"Crucis and μ Crucis who form the \"Southern Cross\".\n"
"\n"
"__December Solstice__\n"
"\n"
"__The “Jorge Trujillo” Arrow:__ The most outstanding stars in the evening of\n"
"the winter solstice for the southern hemisphere are Caph - Shedar - Navi - K\n"
"Cas, they are part of the western constellation of Cassiopeia, the resulting\n"
"form evokes the shape of an arrow that at the end of the December solstice. It\n"
"is in an East - West direction.\n"
"\n"
"The asterisms that we include are the first stars to appear at the end of each\n"
"equinox or solstice. Like the constellations, these basic forms (diamond,\n"
"square, triangle and arrow), mark the beginning or end of a cycle, apparently\n"
"human beings discovered and recorded them before the forms in the dark\n"
"constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### The Sacred Beings in the Cosmos. The Dark Constellations.\n"
"\n"
"#### The Milky Way\n"
"\n"
"Our planet belongs to the galaxy of the Milky Way, whose shape is that of a\n"
"large disk with two bulging arms; this form and the rotation of the earth means\n"
"that at the evenings of the equinoxes and solstices we can appreciate a\n"
"specific part of it, thus becoming a signal that the ancestors appreciated to\n"
"measure the times. Called in the Andes as the \"Muyun\" for many peoples, it\n"
"represents a gigantic life-giving serpent.\n"
"\n"
"Contrary to the West, the constellations are not made up of bright points or\n"
"stars; the astral beings are housed in the \"dark spots\" existing in the\n"
"brilliance of the Milky Way, so at each of the turning points in our annual\n"
"path around the sun (Solstices and Equinoxes), we will find a guiding\n"
"constellation in each \"visible end\" of the galaxy. As with lunar or solar\n"
"movements, the movements of the constellations in the Northern Andes marked the\n"
"beginning or end of specific eras, agricultural, civil, reproductive or\n"
"festive. They determined the fate of beings, receiving respect and veneration\n"
"for those who came for their wisdom; thus developing a religious thought\n"
"similar to that of the sun or the moon throughout the continent.\n"
"\n"
"Here we describe the constellations decoded to date:\n"
"\n"
"#### Dark Constellations\n"

"### 北安第斯山脉\n"
"\n"
"该实验室有一个复杂的实验室，可向我们传授人类在其历史中曾考虑过的各种科学。从观察到围绕我们的各种元素，到确保我们作为物种和宗族生存的需要，人类学会了了解不断发出的宇宙信号：植物，动物，气候和其他元素。然后，明智的人学会了警告那些影响生物的变化。\n"
"\n"
"为了在安第斯天文台中复制祖先的测量数据，我们建议使用宽口容器。在公开场合，我们将其放置并正确调平。为了创建一个星镜，我们将其装满水。在天空的映照下，安第斯圣人可以欣赏并记录太阳，月亮，行星或恒星的运动。\n"
"\n"
"通过恒星模拟，我们可以重新创建这些“宇宙镜”，并分析在整个安第斯山脉以及千禧世代智者中观察到的特定恒星动力学。这些人已经在安第斯民族目前的西班牙裔前遗产中记录了宇宙运动。此外，他们还制作了图形配置，经过21世纪初几代研究人员在几代人的共同努力下，这些图形已部分解码。\n"
"\n"
"在这里，我们告诉我们在赤道天空中发现的东西：\n"
"\n"
"### 太阳（Punchao o Wilca）\n"
"\n"
"当我们发现自己位于行星的中心时，太阳在我们绕行星的年度旅行中所产生的明显运动是等距且成比例的。在春分点，太阳将越过天空的中心（天顶），在冬至的时候太阳将走其最南端的道路（它将向北），在冬至的十二月中，将走过最北的路径（向南更多） ）。这些自然现象是庆祝农业日历特定部分的四个主要节日的标志，因为它们是气候季节之间的拐点。\n"
"\n"
"根据殖民地编年史家胡安·德·贝坦佐斯所说，“印第安人知道the年”。由于古斯塔沃·瓜亚萨米（GustavoGuayasamín）的研究，太阳在每隔四年的时间间隔中发现了一次周期性运动。为了观察这一点，我们建议将自己置于三月春分点（大约三月春分点是公历的第21天），也就是太阳日（2018年民用时间12:20）。然后，借助逐年的“日期/时间窗口”，我们可以及时前进，我们会注意到太阳在移动，返回到观察开始于四年的时间点，例如：从2016年开始，在2017年移至观众的左侧，在2018年继续移至左侧，在2019年也移至2020年，返回初始位置；然后重新开始循环。\n"
"\n"
"### 清除安第斯山脉中的星座，星空和准则。\n"
"\n"
"我们认为，圣人可以通过“星镜”来记录恒星的流量。通过观察，他们注意到在每个春分和冬至的夜晚，特定的星星出现在天空中，好像它们标志着我们所处的气候变化一样，因此这些宇宙信号被记录在安第斯西班牙裔前世袭中，安第斯山脉的几何形式。\n"
"\n"
"_三月春分\n"
"\n"
"*“ Antonio Quinatoa”十字架：*黄昏出现的第一批星星是：Sirius-Procyon-Rigel-Betelgeuse，它们形成一个正方形或一个名为“ Antonio Quinatoa”的十字架。支配男性周期的是星座。\n"
"\n"
"_9月春分\n"
"\n"
"* Molestina三角：*最早出现的星星是：Altair-Vega-组成三角形的Molestina的Antares。\n"
"\n"
"_星座Daniela Alejandra Ayala：感谢外观设计的艰苦努力，我们确定了一个清晰的星座，名为“ Daniela Alejandra Ayala”，这是一个宇宙集，伴随着“ Mono Andino”的形象。它出现在雌性春分的黄昏的天空中心。\n"
"\n"
"_六月至日\n"
"\n"
"_南十字星：北半球夏至之夜最杰出的恒星是：形成“南十字星”的克鲁兹，含羞草，δ克鲁西斯，ζ克鲁西斯，λ克鲁西斯和μ克鲁西斯。\n"
"\n"
"_十二月至日\n"
"\n"
"_“豪尔赫·特鲁希略”箭：南半球冬至之夜最杰出的恒星是Caph-Shedar-Navi-K Cas，它们是仙后座西部星座的一部分，其形成的形状让人联想起箭头表示在冬至结束时。它在东西向。\n"
"\n"
"我们所包括的星号是在每个春分或冬至末出现的第一批恒星。像星座一样，这些基本形式（菱形，正方形，三角形和箭头）标记着一个周期的开始或结束，显然是人类在黑暗的星座中发现并记录了它们。\n"
"\n"
"### 宇宙中的神圣生物。黑暗星座。\n"
"\n"
"#### 银河\n"
"\n"
"我们的星球属于银河系，它的形状是一个带有两个凸起臂的大圆盘。这种形式和地球的自转意味着在春分和至高至晚的夜晚，我们可以欣赏到地球的特定部分，从而成为祖先欣赏测量时间的信号。在安第斯山脉被称为许多民族的“牧云”，它代表了巨大的赋予生命的蛇。\n"
"\n"
"与西方相反，星座不是由亮点或恒星组成的；星体存在于银河系光辉中存在的“暗点”中，因此，在我们绕太阳旋转的年度路径的每个转折点（Solstices和Equinoxes），我们都会在每个“可见光”中找到一个引导星座。结束”。与月球或太阳运动一样，安第斯山脉北部的星座运动标志着农业，民用，生殖或喜庆等特定时代的开始或结束。他们决定众生的命运，为那些为了自己的智慧而来的人们表示敬意和尊敬。因此发展出类似于整个大陆上太阳或月亮的宗教思想。\n"

"在这里，我们描述迄今为止解码的星座图：\n"
