"The sun also passes through these stations spending around 13 to 14 days in the neighborhood of each station, completing 27 x 13 + 14 (One of the stations is assigned 14 days) = 365 days in its yearly trip around the 28 stations. Each station is recognized by a star or a group of stars.\n"
"\n"
"### Historical Overview\n"
"\n"
"_Manazil al-Qamar_, Arabic for the lunar mansions, or stations of the moon is a system of 28 stars, group of stars, or spots in the sky near which the moon is found in each of the 28 nights of its monthly revolution. This system was adopted by the Arabs in the pre-Islamic period, prior to 7th century of the common era. Early mentions of the complete list of the lunar stations is reported by Abd al-Malik Ibn Habeeb (d. 852) on the authority of Malik ibn Anas(d. 795).[#1]\n"
"\n"
"This system was used to fix seasons and predict weather, especially rain.[#2] The Arabs said: each _Naw_ \\[period of 13/14 days\\], is characterized by a distinctive weather pattern of rain, wind and temperature.[#4] The solar year is divided into 28 periods of 13 days each except for one period that is given 14 days, with a total of 365 days. These 28 thirteen-day/fourteen-day periods are called _Anwa'a_, plural of _Naw'_. Each _Naw_ starts at the setting of one of the stars or asterisms, which compose a moon mansion in the west at dawn of morning and the rising of its opposite moon mansion, at the same time, in the east. The _Naw_ is given the name of the setting moon mansion. The setting and rising for each of the 28 moon mansions, one after the other, makes a solar year. _Al-Jabhah_ moon mansion is assigned 14 days.[#3][#4]\n"
"\n"
"A detailed description of the stars of each moon mansion, the times of their heliacal rising and a compilation of astronomical and meteorological knowledge of the ancient Arabs can be found in the _Book of Anwaa_, authored by Ibn Qutaybah (b. 828 - d. 884 or 889). Copies of this book manuscripts survived, and it was printed in India in 1956.[#5]\n"
"\n"
"Use of the moon mansions continued, and because of the importance of identifying them and the times of their heliacal risings, Poems had been composed describing them and short treatises had been written to identify them and suggest the agricultural, travel and medicine practices associated with each mansion. An example poem dedicated to description of the stars of the moon mansions attributed to Muhammadal-Mukri (1578-1638) had been published by Gustave-Adolphe de Calassanti-Motylinski in 1899 in his book \"Les mansions lunaires chez les Arabes\".[#6][#7] A sample treatise is the one written by Shaikh Salih Al-Shethri (d. ~1891), titled \"A time-table for farmers\".[#8]\n"
"\n"
"### Current Use of Moon Stations\n"
"\n"
"Agricultural almanacs based on the heliacal rising of moon stations are still in active use today. The official calendar of Saudi Arabia includes these times.[#9] The following is an example of the use of a moon stations based calendar for the 13 day period starting with the rise of the 3rd moon station _Al-Thurayya_ (Pleiades) on June 7th: \"Weather gets hotter and wind gets stronger. Wild grasses dries. Water in wells gets shallower. Rain is rare during this time. Spring insects start to disappear. Palm tree dates starts to get its colors. It is recommended to irrigate trees with the right amounts and stop irrigation of vines when grapes starts to take its color.\"[#10]\n"
"\n"
"### Identification of the Moon Stations\n"
"\n"
" Ibn Qutabah (b. 828 - d. 884 or 889) in his _Book of Anwaa_ gives detailed description of the stars of each moon station, but an accurate identification can be extracted from the _Book of Fixed Stars_ by Al-Sufi (d. 986). In his book Al-Sufi maps the stars as known to ancient Arabs to those of the Ptolemaic Constellations.\n"
"\n"
"An example of Al-Sufi definitions of the stars of the moon mansions, this definition of _Al-Ghafr_: \"And the 22nd \\[star of Virgo\\] and the 23rd which is on the tail \\[hem of the garment\\] with the 25th on the left foot \\[of Virgo\\] are named \\[by the Arabs\\] _Al-Ghafr_ which is the 15th moon mansion.\"[#11][#12]. Because the star numbers of the Ptolemaic constellations have known coordinates, it is relatively easy to recognize the corresponding Arab star names.\n"
"\n"
"### Notes on star names and the Asterisms of the Moon Stations Sky Culture\n"
"\n"
"Ancient Arabs frequently gave a name to a group of stars, for example, the 3 stars at the belt of Orion (δ\\_Ori, ε\\_Ori and ζ\\_Ori), are named \"String of beads\" _al-Nazhm_ (النظم). In this sky culture they are designated as \"String of beads 1\", \"String of beads 2\" and \"String of beads 3\".\n"
"\n"
"All star names in this sky culture are of ancient Arabic origin, prior to Hellenistic influence, that has been reported by Al-Sufi in his _Book of the Fixed Stars_, with the addition of the following star names:\n"
"\n"
"1.   The Oath star, α\\_Eri _al-Muhlif_ (المحلف): This star was not reported by Ptolemy or Al-Sufi because it couldn't be seen from their northern latitude. Prof. Kunitzsch concluded that it's the star named _al-Muhnith_ (المحنث) which was mentioned in some early resources.[#13] This star is still known in the Arabian peninsula and has the name of _al-Muhlif_ (المحلف) with the same meaning.\n"
"2.   The Two first ones, α\\_UMa and β\\_UMa _al-Awwalaan_ (الأولان): This name of this pair of stars is mentioned by the seafarer Ibn Majid (d. ~1500).[#14] The name is still in use by fishermen of the Red sea.\n"
"3.   The Obscure one, δ\\_UMa _al-Khafi_ (الخافي): This name is mentioned by the seafarer Ibn Majid (d. ~1500).[#15]\n"
"4.   The gazelles, 42\\_Ori, θ2\\_Ori and ι\\_Ori _al-Jawazi_ (الجوازي): This name was reported by Ibn Qutaybah in his book of Anwaa.[#16]\n"
"5.   The Shepherd of the Ostriches, λ\\_Sgr _Ra'i al-Nayyem_ (راعي النعايم): This star is the 9th star of the 20th moon station according to the Poems of Muhammad al-Mukrī[#6] and Mohammad al-Qadhi[#22] See Kunitzsch for the source of this name.[#25]\n"
"\n"
"In translating the meanings of the star names to English, I have tried my best to select the meaning that is more appropriate when the name can have several meanings. The following meanings are worth mentioning because it can be different from meanings previously seen in resources of Arabic star names:\n"
"\n"
"1.    Star α\\_Aur (Capella): ancient Arabic name is _al-Ayyuq_ (العيوق) as reported by Al-Sufi, Ibn Qutaybah and others. The meaning of this name is \"The Obstructor\". In Old Arabic lexicons, The \"obstructor\" comes from the legend that _al-Ayyuq_ is obstructing Aldebaran from meeting _al-Thurayya_ (the Pleiades).[#17][#18]\n"
"2.    Star ε\\_UMa (Alioth): ancient Arabic name is _al-Jawn_ (الجون) as reported by Al-Sufi. This name has several meanings and usually refers to the black color of a horse or a camel. Kunitzsch gave the meaning in German as \"der Rappe\", meaning black horse, but this name also means \"white wild donkey\" or \"wild ass\". Because this star is relatively bright, I preferred the meaning of \"wild donkey\".[#19][#20]\n"
"3.    Stars λ\\_Ori, φ1\\_Ori and φ2\\_Ori: ancient Arabic name is _al-Hakaah_ (الهقعة) as reported by Al-Sufi, Ibn Qutaybah and others. This name means \"the circle on the chest\" or \"the side of the chest\" or \"the spot at the foot of the rider\" that is formed by hair taking different directions on the body of the horse. I found the poem of Muhammad al-Mukrī describes these stars by the spot at the side of the horse near the foot of the rider.[#6] Kunitzsch also mentioned this meaning in \"A Dictionary of Modern Star Names\".[#21]\n"
"\n"
"The asterisms of the moon stations in this sky culture are defined along the identifications reported by al-Sufi with the following notes:\n"
"\n"
"1.   The 4th moon station _Al-Dabaran_ (The Follower \\[of the Pleiades\\]) is composed of one star α\\_Tau (Aldebaran) according to al-Sufi and Ibn Qutaybah. I added to it the V-shaped stars of the Hyades cluster which is the way it is described in the poem of Muhammad al-Mukrī[#6] and another poem of Mohammad al-Qadhi (d. ~1868)[#22].\n"
"2.    The 8th moon station _Al-Nathrah_ (The tip of the nose of the lion) is composed of the Praesepe cluster according to al-Sufi. Ibn Qutaybah adds to the cluster the two stars γ Cnc (Asellus Borealis) and δ Cnc (Asellus Australis).[#23]\n"
"3.    The 20th moon station _Al-Naayem_ (The Ostriches) is the area around the stars: ζ Sgr (Ascella), φ Sgr, δ Sgr (Kaus Media) and ε Sgr (Kaus Australis) according to al-Sufi. Ibn Qutaybah describes this moon station as composed of 8 stars: ς\\_Sgr, φ\\_Sgr, τ\\_Sgr, ζ\\_Sgr, γ\\_Sgr, δ\\_Sgr, ε\\_Sgr, η\\_Sgr.[#24] The Poems of Muhammad al-Mukrī[#6] and Mohammad al-Qadhi[#22] adds a 9th star λ\\_Sgr.\n"
"4.   The 21th moon station _Al-Baldah_ (The empty area) is the area where there are no bright stars between _Al-Naayem_ and _Saad Al-Thabih_. I made an asterism of stars around this spot.\n"

"### The Superlion and Al-Jawza figures of the ancient Arab star lore\n"
"\n"
"One may notice from the names of the 7th to the 15th moon stations that they are part of a lion figure. This Arab lion figure covers around 100 degrees, a little bit more than half the sky dome. From the names of these stars a lion figure can be constructed.\n"
"\n"
"Two of the moon stations, _Al-Hakaah_ and _Al-Hanaah_, are part of Al-Jawza stars. Al-Jawza is the figure covering Orion plus some stars around it. The ancient Arabs imagined these stars as a figure of a woman with a bow and arrow aimed at the lion.\n"
"\n"
"Mr Roland Laffitte discussed these two figure and offered a depiction of each in his article: <a href=\"http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/our-arab-heritage-celestial-vault\">Our Arab Heritage in the Celestial Vault</a>. A more detailed discussion of ancient Arab starlore is found in his book: \"Le Ciel des Arabes\""
