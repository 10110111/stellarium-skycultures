"The sun also passes through these stations. In the _Al-Jabhah_ lunar mansion the sun spends 14 days [#3][#4], while in all others 13 days, completing 27 x 13 + 14 = 365 days in its yearly trip through the 28 stations. Each lunar station is defined by a star or a group of stars.\n"
"\n"
"### Historical Overview\n"
"\n"
"Originally, the _Manazil al-Qamar_, the Arabic for the lunar mansions, or stations of the moon, were a system of 28 stars, group of stars, or spots in the sky near which the moon can be found in each of the 28 nights of its monthly revolution. Early mentions of the complete list of the lunar stations is reported by Abd al-Malik Ibn Habeeb (d. 852) on the authority of Malik ibn Anas (d. 795).[#1] However, this system had been adopted already in the pre-Islamic period, prior to the 7th century of the common era.\n"
"\n"
" Using heliacal observations, the asterisms of the lunar mansions served to divide the siderial and solar year of 365 days into 28 periods of 13 days each except for one period that is given 14 days. These 28 periods are called _Anwa'a_, plural of _Nawa'a_. Each _Nawa'a_ is determined by a characteristical star: when this star rises in the morning during dawn (in the east, so, shortly before the Sun), this is the beginning of the next _Nawa'a_. The name of the _Nawa'a_ (period of time, half month), gives the lunar mansion its name. One complete cycle of setting and rising for each of the 28 lunar mansions, one after the other, makes a solar year. \n"
"This system was used to determine the seasons and predict weather, especially rain.[#2] The Arabs said: each _Nawa'a_ \\[period of 13/14 days\\] is characterized by a distinctive weather pattern of rain, wind, and temperature.[#4] \n"
"\n"
"A detailed description of the stars of each lunar mansion, the times of their heliacal rising and a compilation of astronomical and meteorological knowledge of the ancient Arabs can be found in the _Book of Anwaa_, authored by Ibn Qutaybah (b. 828 - d. 884 or 889). Copies of this book manuscripts survived, and it was printed in India in 1956.[#5]\n"
"\n"
" The usage of the lunar mansions continued and even influenced astrological belief, causing agricultural, travel and medicine practices associated with the lunar mansions. Due to the importance of observing the times of their heliacal risings, poems have been composed describing the relevant asteris short treatises and poems have been written on these asterisms, e.g. a poem dedicated to description of the stars of the lunar mansions was published by Gustave-Adolphe de Calassanti-Motylinski in 1899 in his book \"Les mansions lunaires chez les Arabes\", attributed to Muhammadal-Mukri (1578-1638).[#6][#7] A sample treatise is the one written by Shaikh Salih Al-Shethri (d. ~1891), titled \"A time-table for farmers\".[#8]\n"
"\n"
"### Current Usage of Lunar Stations\n"
"\n"
"Agricultural almanacs based on the heliacal rising of lunar stations are still in active use today. The official calendar of Saudi Arabia includes these times.[#9] The following is an example of the use of a lunar station based calendar for the 13 days period starting with the rise of the 3rd lunar station _Al-Thurayya_ (Pleiades) on June 7th: \"Weather gets hotter and wind gets stronger. Wild grasses dries. Water in wells gets shallower. Rain is rare during this time. Spring insects start to disappear. Palm tree dates starts to get its colors. It is recommended to irrigate trees with the right amounts and stop irrigation of vines when grapes starts to get its color.\"[#10]\n"
"\n"
"### Identification of the Lunar Stations\n"
"\n"
" Ibn Qutabah (b. 828 - d. 884 or 889) in his _Book of Anwaa_ gives detailed description of the stars of each lunar station while an accurate identification can be extracted from the _Book of Fixed Stars_ by Al-Sufi (d. 986). In his book, Al-Sufi maps the stars as known to ancient Arabs to those of the Ptolemaic Constellations.\n"
"\n"
"An example of Al-Sufi definitions of the stars of the lunar mansions, here is the definition of _Al-Ghafr_: \"And the 22nd \\[star of Virgo\\] and the 23rd which is on the tail \\[hem of the garment\\] with the 25th on the left foot \\[of Virgo\\] are named \\[by the Arabs\\] _Al-Ghafr_ which is the 15th lunar mansion.\"[#11][#12]. Because the stars of the Ptolemaic constellations have known coordinates, it is relatively easy to identify the Arab star names.\n"
"\n"
"### Notes on Star Names and Asterisms of this Sky Culture\n"
"\n"
"Ancient Arabs frequently named groups of stars, for example, the 3 stars at the belt of Orion (δ Ori, ε Ori and ζ Ori), are named \"String of beads\" _al-Nazhm_ (النظم). In this sky culture they are designated as \"String of beads 1\", \"String of beads 2\" and \"String of beads 3\".\n"
"\n"
"All star names in this sky culture are of ancient Arabic origin, prior to Hellenistic influence, that has been reported by Al-Sufi in his _Book of the Fixed Stars_, with the addition of the following star names:\n"
"\n"
"1.   The Oath star, α Eri _al-Muhlif_ (المحلف): This star was not reported by Ptolemy or Al-Sufi because it couldn't be seen from their northern latitude. Prof. Kunitzsch concluded that it's the star named _al-Muhnith_ (المحنث) which was mentioned in some early resources.[#13] This star is still known on the Arabian peninsula and has the name of _al-Muhlif_ (المحلف) with the same meaning.\n"
"2.   The First One (beginning of spring), α UMa and β UMa _al-Awwalaan_ (الأولان): This name of this pair of stars is mentioned by the seafarer Ibn Majid (d. ~1500).[#14] The name is still in use by fishermen of the Red Sea.\n"
"3.   The Obscure one, δ UMa _al-Khafi_ (الخافي): This name is mentioned by the seafarer Ibn Majid (d. ~1500).[#15]\n"
"4.   The gazelles, 42 Ori, θ2 Ori and ι Ori _al-Jawazi_ (الجوازي): This name was reported by Ibn Qutaybah in his _Book of Anwaa_.[#16]\n"
"5.   The Shepherd of the Ostriches, λ Sgr _Ra'i al-Nayyem_ (راعي النعايم): This star is the 9th star of the 20th lunar station according to the Poems of Muhammad al-Mukrī[#6] and Mohammad al-Qadhi[#22] See Kunitzsch for the source of this name.[#25]\n"
"\n"
"In translating the meanings of the star names to English, I have tried my best to select the meaning that is more appropriate when the name can have several meanings. The following meanings are worth mentioning because it can be different from meanings previously seen in resources of Arabic star names:\n"
"\n"
"1.    Star α Aur (Capella): ancient Arabic name is _al-Ayyuq_ (العيوق) as reported by Al-Sufi, Ibn Qutaybah and others. The meaning of this name is \"The Obstructor\". In Old Arabic lexicons, The \"obstructor\" comes from the legend that _al-Ayyuq_ is obstructing Aldebaran from meeting _al-Thurayya_ (the Pleiades).[#17][#18]\n"
"2.    Star ε UMa (Alioth): ancient Arabic name is _al-Jawn_ (الجون) as reported by Al-Sufi. This name has several meanings: Because it usually refers to the black color of a horse or a camel, Kunitzsch translated the name into German as \"der Rappe\", black horse, but the Arabic term also means \"white wild donkey\" or \"wild ass\". Because this star is relatively bright, I preferred the meaning of \"wild donkey\".[#19][#20]\n"
"3.    Stars λ Ori, φ<sub>1</sub> Ori and φ<sub>2</sub> Ori: ancient Arabic name is _al-Hakaah_ (الهقعة) as reported by Al-Sufi, Ibn Qutaybah and others. This name means \"the circle on the chest\" or \"the side of the chest\" or \"the spot at the foot of the rider\" which is formed by hair taking different directions on the body of the horse. I found the poem of Muhammad al-Mukrī describing these stars by the spot at the side of the horse near the foot of the rider.[#6] Kunitzsch also mentioned this meaning in \"A Dictionary of Modern Star Names\".[#21]\n"
"\n"
"The asterisms of the lunar stations in this sky culture are defined along the identifications reported by al-Sufi with the following notes:\n"
"\n"
"1.   The 4th lunar station _Al-Dabaran_ (The Follower \\[of the Pleiades\\]) is composed of one star α Tau (Aldebaran) according to al-Sufi and Ibn Qutaybah. I added the V-shaped star cluster of the Hyades based on the description in poems of Muhammad al-Mukrī[#6] and of Mohammad al-Qadhi (d. ~1868)[#22].\n"
"2.    The 8th lunar station _Al-Nathrah_ (The tip of the nose of the lion) is composed of the Praesepe cluster according to al-Sufi. Ibn Qutaybah adds the two stars γ Cnc (Asellus Borealis) and δ Cnc (Asellus Australis).[#23]\n"
"3.    The 20th lunar station _Al-Naayem_ (The Ostriches) is the area around the stars: ζ Sgr (Ascella), φ Sgr, δ Sgr (Kaus Media) and ε Sgr (Kaus Australis) according to al-Sufi. Ibn Qutaybah describes this lunar station as composed of 8 stars: ς Sgr, φ Sgr, τ Sgr, ζ Sgr, γ Sgr, δ Sgr, ε Sgr, η Sgr.[#24] The Poems of Muhammad al-Mukrī[#6] and Mohammad al-Qadhi[#22] adds a 9th star λ Sgr.\n"
"4.   The 21st lunar station _Al-Baldah_ (The empty area) is the area where there are no bright stars between _Al-Naayem_ and _Saad Al-Thabih_. I made an asterism of stars around this spot.\n"

"### The Superlion and Al-Jawza figures of the ancient Arab star lore\n"
"\n"
"One may notice from the names of the 7th to the 15th lunar stations that they are part of a lion figure. This Arab lion figure covers around 100 degrees, a little bit more than half of the sky dome. From the names of these stars a lion figure can be constructed.\n"
"\n"
"Two of the lunar stations, _Al-Hakaah_ and _Al-Hanaah_, are part of Al-Jawza stars. Al-Jawza is the figure covering Orion plus some stars around it. The ancient Arabs imagined these stars as a figure of a woman with a bow and arrow aimed at the lion (an image, probably influenced from Roman Egypt: see depiction on Denderah zodiac which shows Babylonian as well as Greek traces of constellations).\n"
"\n"
"Mr Roland Laffitte discussed these two figure and offered a depiction of each in his article: [Our Arab Heritage in the Celestial Vault](http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/our-arab-heritage-celestial-vault). A more detailed discussion of ancient Arab starlore is found in his book: \"Le Ciel des Arabes\" [#26]."
