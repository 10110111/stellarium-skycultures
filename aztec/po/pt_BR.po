"The Aztecs were an indigene group of peoples in Mesoamerica, especially central\n"
"parts of Mexico. Their culture flourished from 13th to 15th century. However, a\n"
"great part of this knowledge was lost as a consequence of the Spanish conquest\n"
"which occurred on continental America in the 16th century.\n"
"\n"
"The elements of the Aztec society such as culture, economy and science are\n"
"preserved in the _tlacuilos_. This term loans from _tlacuiloa_, a word in the\n"
"ancient Aztec language (Nahuatl,[#12],[#13]) that means _writing with\n"
"drawings_. These Tlacuilos where stored in the _amoxcalli_ (books) and _calli_\n"
"(house). Later, they became known as _codices_; a word that came from the Latin\n"
"word Codex meaning 'written book'. They were drawn in many different materials\n"
"such as deer skin, _amate_ (paper) or cotton fabric and they had no text only\n"
"drawings called _glifos_ [#5],[#6].\n"
"\n"
"Although, many of the pre-hispanic Codices were destroyed during the Spanish\n"
"conquest, some native Americans and some Spanish priests have been working for\n"
"keeping collections and continuing the Mesoamerican customs from earlier\n"
"epochs. In the newly produced Colonial Codices, there is a change of the\n"
"drawing style because of new techniques and the new materials imported from\n"
"Europe. Additionally, descriptive text in these new manuscripts have been\n"
"written in a mixture of both languages, Spanish and Nahuatl.\n"

"Sadly, the Aztec astronomical knowledge in the remaining codexes is really\n"
"small. The next image is one of the few that names some constellations and\n"
"astronomical phenomena identified by the Aztec, it belong to the _Primeros\n"
"Memoriales_ (first memorials), a colonial manuscript of the 16th century\n"
"written by Fray Bernardino de Sahagun.\n"

"\n"
"### Conclusion\n"
"\n"
"It is noteworthy that the interpretation of some of these constellations are\n"
"still in discussion, and of course there must be other constellations to\n"
"represent. Any comments and/or collaboration are welcome in order to preserve\n"
"the stellar knowledge, myths and starlore of the Aztec culture."
