"For ancient aztecs, the knowledge of the night skies and stars movement had "
"great importance for their calendars and the measurement of both "
"agricultural and sacred cycles. However, great part of this knowledge was "
"lost as consequence of the Spanish conquest which occurred on continental "
"America in the 16th century."

"The elements of the Aztec society such as culture, economy and science is preserved in the _tlacuilos_, word that comes from the ancient Nahuatl word _tlacuiloa_, which means _writing with drawings_. These Tlacuilos where stored in the _amoxcalli_, meaning amoxtli: books and calli: house. Later their became known as _codices_; a word that came from the Latin word Codex which means written book.\n"

"After the Spanish conquest many of the pre-hispanic Codexes where destroyed, their main feature is that their where drawn in many different materials such as deer skin, _amate_ paper or cotton fabric and they had no text only draws or _glifos_. However the collection of Mesoamerican customs continued prior to the Spanish conquest thanks to the work of some native indians and some Spanish priests, this codexes are known as Colonial Codexes and there is a change of the way of drawing because of the new techniques of drawing and the new materials imported from Europe, also because of the incorporation of descriptive text both in Spanish and Nahuatl.\n"

"Sadly, the Aztec astronomical knowledge in the remaining codexes is really small. The next image is one of the few that names some constellations and astronomical phenomena identified by the Aztec, it belong to the _Primeros Memoriales_ (first memorials), which is a colonial manuscript of the 16th century written by Fray Bernardino de Sahagun.\n"

"### Conclusion\n"
"\n"
"It is noteworthy that the interpretation of some of these constellations are still in discussion, and of course there must be other constellations to represent. Any comments and/or collaboration are welcome in order to preserve the stellar knowledge and meaning of the Aztec culture.\n"
