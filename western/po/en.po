"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"The Western culture divides the celestial sphere into 88 areas of various sizes called _constellations_, each with precise boundary, issued by the International Astronomical Union. These constellations have become the standard way to describe the sky, replacing similar sets in other sky cultures exhaustively in daily usage.\n"
"\n"
"### Star names\n"
"\n"
"Most of traditional western star names came from Arabic. In astronomy, Bayer/Flamsteed designations and other star catalogues are widely used instead of traditional names except few cases where the traditional names are more famous than the designations."
