"Due to the rapidly increasing number of known stars and nebulae, richly illustrated atlases with sumptuously engraved mythological figures had fallen out of fashion in the 19th century. The last atlas of this style was Bode, Uranographia, Berlin, 1801 and its format had to be huge (92 x 130 cm) in order to depict all contemporarily known objects below the detailed drawings. \n"
"\n"
"The development was split up: The popular maps for beginner's guides and public relation were illustrated with beautiful paintings of constellations but abstained from displying all astronomical content known while the maps used in professional observatories (e.g. the international Cartes du Ciel project) abstained from any lines and constellations drawings but depicted the stars and nebulae only. \n"
"\n"
"Later, varous artists compete to suggest stick figures that connect some bright stars within the constellation areas but these suggestions were initially not meaningful. Thus, Rey's suggestion in 1952 to draw stick figures that trigger the reader's phantasy had some impact: It shows that over several decades, the figures had ceased to resemble the figures they were named after and appeared incomprehensible to beginning stargazers.\n"

"\n"
"H. A. Rey (Hans Augusto Reyersbach, 1898-1977) was a poster artist of German descent who became extraordinarily successful as author of children's books in New York. His answer to the astronomical stick figure problem is published in the book _The Stars - A New Way To See Them_, (1952).\n"
"\n"
"### The Constellations\n"
"\n"
"In this book, which has become very popular especially in the U.S., Rey connected the stars of every constellation \"in such a way that the resulting shape makes sense.\" What surprised him was \"that nobody has done it before. The basic idea is so simple.\" \n"
"\n"
"Rey's new stick figures make it indeed very simple to recognize the depicted constellation figures. Rey's work does not include figurative artwork, therefore this sky culture deliberately only comes with Rey's original stick figures. Rey's constellation names were also always given in English. If you switch to \"Native\" name display mode, you may see exactly the spelling used in his book. Also the stars named here are limited to those included in the book.\n"
"\n"
"### Rey's Figures and the Classic Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Rey's constellations adhere to the tradition of the modern international sky culture of 88 official constellation areas. However, he includes some asterisms commonly used for the orientation, such as the two Northern Dippers of the Greco-Babylonian tradition and the \"Great Square\" (in Pegasus and Andromeda). However, at several points Rey's figures deviate from the canonical figures described since Ptolemy's Almagest (2nd century AD), where also positions of the stars in their constellations had been described in their names. For example:\n"
"\n"
" * Rey inverted the figure of the Great Bear (_Ursa Major_) to look like a polar bear scenting prey. On the one hand, this does not have the usual problem to explain its long tail. On the other hand, the bear is not shown to walk around the pole in this orientation.\n"
" * The Bull (_Taurus_), only the front of which is shown with long upright horns in usual depictions, is shown with a complete body including its tail, with horns stretched wide like those of a buffalo. Its bright eye _Aldebaran_ now lies in its neck.\n"
" * The head of _Hercules_ is usually next to the head of _Ophiuchus_, the serpent holder, and the four stars known as \"keystone\" form his body. Rey makes his head out of the keystone, and the star that usually marks the hero's head is now one of his feet.\n"
" * The Greek Sea Monster (_Cetus_) is translated as \"Whale\" (like common in German but wrong) and the figure has been turned around, its formermouth now forming a tail fin.\n"
" * _Pegasus_ exchanged feet and head.\n"
" * _Bootes_, the herdsman, is shown sitting and smoking a pipe (no trace of political correctness in a children's book of the 1950s... :-))"

"由于已知的恒星和星云的数量迅速增加，带有丰富雕刻的神话人物的插图集地图集在19世纪已经过时。这种风格的最后一幅地图集是1801年在柏林的乌德纳波勒（Uranographia）博德博物馆，其格式必须很大（92 x 130厘米），以便在详细图纸下方显示所有当代已知的物体。\n"
"\n"
"发展是分开的：为初学者指南和公共关系提供的受欢迎的地图以美丽的星座画作插图，但由于没有显示所有已知的天文内容而被弃用，而在专业观测所（例如国际Cartes du Ciel项目）中使用的地图则从任何线条上都被弃用。和星座图，但仅描绘了恒星和星云。\n"
"\n"
"后来，各种各样的艺术家竞相推荐棒图，这些棒图将星座区域内的一些亮星连接起来，但是这些建议最初没有意义。因此，雷伊（Rey）在1952年提出的绘制简笔画触发读者幻想的建议产生了一定的影响：它表明，在过去的几十年中，这些人物不再像他们被命名的人物那样，对于初学者来说似乎是难以理解的。\n"

"HA Rey（Hans Augusto Reyersbach，1898-1977年）是德国血统的海报画家，在纽约以儿童读物的著者而异常成功。他对天文棒形人物问题的回答发表在《星星-看他们的新方法》（The Stars-A New Way To Seem）中（1952）。\n"
"\n"
"###星座\n"
"\n"
"在这本书中（特别是在美国非常流行），雷伊“以一种使得最终形状有意义的方式，将每个星座的恒星联系在一起”。使他感到惊讶的是“以前没有人做过。基本思想是如此简单。”\n"
"\n"
"雷伊（Rey）的新棒形图确实使识别所描绘的星座图非常简单。雷伊的作品不包括具象艺术品，因此，这种天空文化特意只与雷伊的原始简笔画一起出现。雷伊的星座名称也总是用英语给出。如果切换到“本机”名称显示模式，则可能会准确看到其书中使用的拼写。同样，此处命名的星星仅限于本书中包含的星星。\n"
"\n"
"###雷伊的雕像和经典星座\n"
"\n"
"雷伊的星座遵循88个官方星座地区的现代国际天空文化传统。但是，他包括一些通常用于定位的星号，例如希腊-巴比伦传统的两个北斗七星和“大广场”（在飞马和仙女座）。但是，雷伊的数字在某些方面与托勒密的《阿尔玛格斯特》（公元2世纪）以来描述的经典数字有所不同，在托勒密的《阿尔玛格斯特》中，星星的位置也以它们的名字进行了描述。例如：\n"
"\n"
"雷伊（Rey）颠倒了大熊（Ursa Major_）的身材，使其看起来像北极熊的猎物。一方面，这没有通常的问题来解释其长尾巴。另一方面，未示出熊在该方向上绕杆行走。\n"
"*公牛（_Taurus_），在通常的描绘中仅以长直的角示出了其前部，并以包括其尾巴的完整身体来示出，其角像水牛一样被展宽。现在，它的明亮眼睛_Aldebaran_躺在脖子上。\n"
"*“大力神”的头通常紧挨着“蛇夫座”的头，蛇的持有人，并由四颗被称为“梯形”的星星组成他的身体。雷伊（Rey）使自己的头脱离了梯形，通常标记英雄头部的星星现在已成为他的脚之一。\n"
"*希腊海怪（_Cetus_）被翻译为“鲸鱼”（与德语一样，但错误），并且该图已被转过头来，它的前嘴现在形成了尾鳍。\n"
"* _Pegasus_交换了脚和头。\n"
"*牧民_Bootes_坐着并抽着烟斗（在1950年代的儿童读物中没有政治上的正确性……:-)"
