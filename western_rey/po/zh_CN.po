"\n"
"During the 19th century the use and further editions of richly illustrated\n"
"atlases with sumptuously engraved mythological figures fell out of fashion. The\n"
"stars of the constellations in atlases of that time started to be shown\n"
"connected with line patterns (\"stickfigures\"), which however appear sometimes\n"
"only to have been used to indicate which stars belong to which constellation.\n"
"\n"
"Over several decades the figures had ceased to resemble the figures they were\n"
"named after and appeared incomprehensible to beginning stargazers in the middle\n"
"of the 20th century. H. A. Rey (Hans Augusto Reyersbach) (1898-1977), an artist\n"
"and author of children's books of German descent but emigrated to the USA,\n"
"published his answer to this problem in 1952 with the book _The Stars - A New\n"
"Way To See Them_.\n"
"\n"
"### The Constellations\n"
"\n"
"In this book, which has become very popular especially in the US, Rey connected\n"
"the stars of every constellation \"in such a way that the resulting shape makes\n"
"sense.\" What surprised him was \"that nobody has done it before. The basic idea\n"
"is so simple.\"\n"
"\n"
"Rey's new stick figures make it indeed very simple to recognize the depicted\n"
"constellation figures. Rey's work does not include figurative artwork,\n"
"therefore this sky culture deliberately only comes with Rey's original stick\n"
"figures. The constellation names were also always given in English by Rey. If\n"
"you switch to \"Native\" name display mode, you may see exactly the spelling used\n"
"in his book. Also the stars named here are limited to those included in the\n"
"book.\n"
"\n"
"### Rey's Figures and the Classic Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Rey's constellations adhere to the tradition of the Western sky culture and\n"
"describes the 88 officially acknowledged constellations, with addition of\n"
"asterisms of the two Dippers and the \"Great Square\" (of Pegasus). However, at\n"
"several points Rey's figures deviate from the canonical figures described since\n"
"Ptolemy's Almagest (2nd century AD), where also positions of the stars in their\n"
"constellations had been described in their names. For example:\n"
"\n"
" * Rey inverted the figure of the Great Bear (_Ursa Major_) to look like a polar\n"
"bear scenting prey. This on one hand does not have the usual problem to explain\n"
"its long tail. On the other hand, the bear is not shown to walk around the pole\n"
"in this orientation.\n"
"\n"
" * The Bull (_Taurus_), only the front of which is shown with long upright horns\n"
"in usual depictions, is shown with a complete body including its tail, with\n"
"horns stretched wide like those of a buffalo. Its bright eye _Aldebaran_ now\n"
"lies in its neck.\n"
"\n"
" * The head of _Hercules_ is usually next to the head of _Ophiuchus_, the\n"
"serpent holder, and the four stars known as \"keystone\" form his body. Rey makes\n"
"his head out of the keystone, and the star that usually marks the hero's head\n"
"is now one of his feet.\n"
"\n"
" * The Whale (_Cetus_) has been turned around, its formermouth now forming a\n"
"tail fin.\n"
"\n"
" * _Pegasus_ exchanged feet and head.\n"
"\n"
" * _Bootes_, the herdsman, is shown sitting and smoking a pipe (no trace of\n"
"political correctness in a children's book of the 1950s!)"

"\n"
"在19世纪，带有精美雕刻的神话人物的插图集地图集的使用和进一步版本过时了。那时开始显示图集中的星座中的星星与线型（“线条图”）相关联，但是有时似乎只是用来指示哪些星星属于哪个星座。\n"
"\n"
"在过去的几十年中，这些人物不再像他们所命名的人物那样，并且对于20世纪中叶的观星者来说似乎是难以理解的。 H. A. Rey（Hans Augusto Reyersbach）（1898-1977）是德国后裔儿童书籍的艺术家和作家，但移居美国后，他于1952年出版了《星辰-一种看待他们的新方式》一书，阐述了他对这一问题的回答。\n"
"\n"
"### 星座\n"
"\n"
"在这本书中（特别是在美国非常流行），雷伊“以一种使得最终形状有意义的方式，将每个星座的恒星联系在一起”。使他感到惊讶的是“以前没有人做过。基本思想是如此简单。”\n"
"\n"
"雷伊（Rey）的新棒形图确实使识别所描绘的星座图非常简单。雷伊的作品不包括具象艺术品，因此，这种天空文化特意只与雷伊的原始简笔画一起出现。星座名称也总是由Rey用英语给出。如果切换到“本机”名称显示模式，则可能会准确看到其书中使用的拼写。同样，此处命名的星星仅限于本书中包含的星星。\n"
"\n"
"### 雷伊的雕像和经典星座\n"
"\n"
"雷伊（Rey）的星座遵循西方天空文化的传统，描述了88个官方认可的星座，并增加了两个北斗七星和“大广场”（飞马座）的星号。但是，雷伊的数字在某些方面与托勒密的《阿尔玛格斯特》（公元2世纪）以来描述的经典数字有所不同，在托勒密的《阿尔玛格斯特》中，星星的位置也以它们的名字进行了描述。例如：\n"
"\n"
" 雷伊（Rey）颠倒了大熊（Ursa Major）的身材，使其看起来像北极熊的猎物。一方面，这没有通常的问题来解释其长尾巴。另一方面，未示出熊在该方向上绕杆行走。\n"
"\n"
" *公牛（金牛座）在通常的描绘中仅以长直的牛角显示其前部，并以完整的身体（包括其尾巴）显示，牛角像水牛一样被展宽。现在，它明亮的眼睛Aldebaran躺在脖子上。\n"
"\n"
" *大力神的头通常紧挨蛇夫座（蛇的持有人）的头，而四颗被称为“基石”的恒星形成他的身体。雷伊（Rey）使他的头脱离了梯形，通常标记英雄头部的星星现在已成为他的脚之一。\n"
"\n"
" *鲸鱼（Cetus）已转过头来，它的前嘴现在形成了尾鳍。\n"
"\n"
" *飞马交换了脚和头。\n"
"\n"
" *牧民的靴子坐着抽着烟斗（在1950年代的儿童读物中没有任何政治上的正确性！）"
