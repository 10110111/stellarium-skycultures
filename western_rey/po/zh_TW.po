"During the 19th century the use and further editions of richly illustrated\n"
"atlases with sumptuously engraved mythological figures fell out of fashion. The\n"
"stars of the constellations in atlases of that time started to be shown\n"
"connected with line patterns (\"stickfigures\"), which however appear sometimes\n"
"only to have been used to indicate which stars belong to which constellation.\n"
"\n"
"Over several decades the figures had ceased to resemble the figures they were\n"
"named after and appeared incomprehensible to beginning stargazers in the middle\n"
"of the 20th century. H. A. Rey (Hans Augusto Reyersbach) (1898-1977), an artist\n"
"and author of children's books of German descent but emigrated to the USA,\n"
"published his answer to this problem in 1952 with the book _The Stars - A New\n"
"Way To See Them_.\n"
"\n"
"### The Constellations\n"
"\n"
"In this book, which has become very popular especially in the US, Rey connected\n"
"the stars of every constellation \"in such a way that the resulting shape makes\n"
"sense.\" What surprised him was \"that nobody has done it before. The basic idea\n"
"is so simple.\"\n"
"\n"
"Rey's new stick figures make it indeed very simple to recognize the depicted\n"
"constellation figures. Rey's work does not include figurative artwork,\n"
"therefore this sky culture deliberately only comes with Rey's original stick\n"
"figures. The constellation names were also always given in English by Rey. If\n"
"you switch to \"Native\" name display mode, you may see exactly the spelling used\n"
"in his book. Also the stars named here are limited to those included in the\n"
"book.\n"
"\n"
"### Rey's Figures and the Classic Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Rey's constellations adhere to the tradition of the Western sky culture and\n"
"describes the 88 officially acknowledged constellations, with addition of\n"
"asterisms of the two Dippers and the \"Great Square\" (of Pegasus). However, at\n"
"several points Rey's figures deviate from the canonical figures described since\n"
"Ptolemy's Almagest (2nd century AD), where also positions of the stars in their\n"
"constellations had been described in their names. For example:\n"
"\n"
" * Rey inverted the figure of the Great Bear (_Ursa Major_) to look like a polar\n"
"bear scenting prey. This on one hand does not have the usual problem to explain\n"
"its long tail. On the other hand, the bear is not shown to walk around the pole\n"
"in this orientation.\n"
"\n"
" * The Bull (_Taurus_), only the front of which is shown with long upright horns\n"
"in usual depictions, is shown with a complete body including its tail, with\n"
"horns stretched wide like those of a buffalo. Its bright eye _Aldebaran_ now\n"
"lies in its neck.\n"
"\n"
" * The head of _Hercules_ is usually next to the head of _Ophiuchus_, the\n"
"serpent holder, and the four stars known as \"keystone\" form his body. Rey makes\n"
"his head out of the keystone, and the star that usually marks the hero's head\n"
"is now one of his feet.\n"
"\n"
" * The Whale (_Cetus_) has been turned around, its formermouth now forming a\n"
"tail fin.\n"
"\n"
" * _Pegasus_ exchanged feet and head.\n"
"\n"
" * _Bootes_, the herdsman, is shown sitting and smoking a pipe (no trace of\n"
"political correctness in a children's book of the 1950s!)"

"在19世紀，帶有精美雕刻的神話人物的圖集的使用和進一步版本過時了。那時開始顯示圖集中的星座中的星星與線型（“線條圖”）相關聯，但是有時似乎只是用來指示哪些星星屬於哪個星座。\n"
"\n"
"在過去的幾十年中，這些人物不再像他們所命名的人物那樣，並且對於20世紀中葉的觀星者來說似乎是難以理解的。 H. A. Rey（Hans Augusto Reyersbach）（1898-1977）是德國後裔兒童書籍的藝術家和作家，但移居美國後，他於1952年出版了《星辰-一種看待他們的新方式》一書。\n"
"\n"
"### 星座\n"
"\n"
"在這本書中（特別是在美國非常流行），雷伊“以一種使得最終形狀有意義的方式，將每個星座的恆星聯繫在一起”。使他感到驚訝的是“以前沒有人做過。基本思想是如此簡單。”\n"
"\n"
"雷伊（Rey）的新棒形圖確實使識別所描繪的星座圖非常簡單。雷伊的作品不包含具象藝術品，因此，這種天空文化特意只與雷伊的原始簡筆劃一起出現。星座名稱也總是由雷伊（Rey）用英語給出。如果切換到“本機”名稱顯示模式，則可能會準確看到其書中使用的拼寫。同樣，此處命名的星星僅限於本書中包含的星星。\n"
"\n"
"### 雷伊的雕像和經典星座\n"
"\n"
"雷伊（Rey）的星座遵循西方天空文化的傳統，描述了88個官方認可的星座，另外還有兩個北斗七星和“大廣場”（飛馬座）的星號。但是，雷伊的數字在某些方面與托勒密的《阿爾瑪格斯特》（公元2世紀）以來描述的經典數字有所不同，在托勒密的《阿爾瑪格斯特》中，星星的位置也用它們的名字進行了描述。例如：\n"
"\n"
" 雷伊（Rey）顛倒了大熊（Ursa Major）的身材，使其看起來像北極熊的獵物。一方面，這沒有通常的問題來解釋其長尾巴。另一方面，未示出熊在該方向上繞桿行走。\n"
"\n"
" *公牛（金牛座），在通常的描繪中僅以長直的牛角顯示其前部，並以包括其尾巴的完整身體顯示，牛角像水牛一樣被展寬。現在，它明亮的眼睛Aldebaran躺在脖子上。\n"
"\n"
" *大力神的頭通常緊挨蛇夫座的頭，蛇的持有人，而四顆被稱為“基石”的恆星形成他的身體。雷伊（Rey）使他的頭部脫離了梯形，通常標記英雄頭部的星星現在已成為他的腳之一。\n"
"\n"
" *鯨魚（Cetus）已轉過頭來，它的前嘴現在形成了尾鰭。\n"
"\n"
" *飛馬交換了腳和頭。\n"
"\n"
" *牧民的靴子坐著抽著煙斗（在1950年代的兒童讀物中沒有政治上的正確性！）"
