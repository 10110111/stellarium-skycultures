"當國際天文學聯合會（IAU）的一項決定將星座區域的邊界定為標準[#4]時，天文學家並未定義想像這些邊界內線型的方法。自從Rey在1952年撰寫這本書以來，一種簡化的繪製簡筆劃的方法就很受歡迎。"

"Due to the rapidly increasing number of known stars and nebulae, richly illustrated atlases with sumptuously engraved mythological figures had fallen out of fashion in the 19th century. The last atlas of this style was Bode, Uranographia, Berlin, 1801 and its format had to be huge (92 x 130 cm) in order to depict all contemporarily known objects below the detailed drawings. \n"
"\n"
"The development was split up: The popular maps for beginner's guides and public relation were illustrated with beautiful paintings of constellations but abstained from displying all astronomical content known while the maps used in professional observatories (e.g. the international Cartes du Ciel project) abstained from any lines and constellations drawings but depicted the stars and nebulae only. \n"
"\n"
"Later, varous artists compete to suggest stick figures that connect some bright stars within the constellation areas but these suggestions were initially not meaningful. Thus, Rey's suggestion in 1952 to draw stick figures that trigger the reader's phantasy had some impact: It shows that over several decades, the figures had ceased to resemble the figures they were named after and appeared incomprehensible to beginning stargazers.\n"
"\n"
"![Rey Cover](Rey_cover.webp)\n"
"\n"
"H. A. Rey (Hans Augusto Reyersbach, 1898-1977) was a poster artist of German descent who became extraordinarily successful as author of children's books in New York. His answer to the astronomical stick figure problem is published in the book _The Stars - A New Way To See Them_, (1952).\n"
"\n"
"### The Constellations\n"
"\n"
"In this book, which has become very popular especially in the U.S., Rey connected the stars of every constellation \"in such a way that the resulting shape makes sense.\" What surprised him was \"that nobody has done it before. The basic idea is so simple.\" \n"
"\n"
"Rey's new stick figures make it indeed very simple to recognize the depicted constellation figures. Rey's work does not include figurative artwork, therefore this sky culture deliberately only comes with Rey's original stick figures. Rey's constellation names were also always given in English. If you switch to \"Native\" name display mode, you may see exactly the spelling used in his book. Also the stars named here are limited to those included in the book.\n"
"\n"
"### Rey's Figures and the Classic Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Rey's constellations adhere to the tradition of the modern international sky culture of 88 official constellation areas. However, he includes some asterisms commonly used for the orientation, such as the two Northern Dippers of the Greco-Babylonian tradition and the \"Great Square\" (in Pegasus and Andromeda). However, at several points Rey's figures deviate from the canonical figures described since Ptolemy's Almagest (2nd century AD), where also positions of the stars in their constellations had been described in their names. For example:\n"
"\n"
" * Rey inverted the figure of the Great Bear (_Ursa Major_) to look like a polar bear scenting prey. On the one hand, this does not have the usual problem to explain its long tail. On the other hand, the bear is not shown to walk around the pole in this orientation.\n"
" * The Bull (_Taurus_), only the front of which is shown with long upright horns in usual depictions, is shown with a complete body including its tail, with horns stretched wide like those of a buffalo. Its bright eye _Aldebaran_ now lies in its neck.\n"
" * The head of _Hercules_ is usually next to the head of _Ophiuchus_, the serpent holder, and the four stars known as \"keystone\" form his body. Rey makes his head out of the keystone, and the star that usually marks the hero's head is now one of his feet.\n"
" * The Greek Sea Monster (_Cetus_) is translated as \"Whale\" (like common in German but wrong) and the figure has been turned around, its formermouth now forming a tail fin.\n"
" * _Pegasus_ exchanged feet and head.\n"
" * _Bootes_, the herdsman, is shown sitting and smoking a pipe (no trace of political correctness in a children's book of the 1950s... :-))"

"由於已知恆星和星雲的數量迅速增加，帶有豐富雕刻的神話人物插圖的地圖集在19世紀已經過時。這種風格的最後一幅地圖集是1801年在柏林的烏德納波勒（Uranographia）博德博物館，其格式必須很大（92 x 130厘米），以便在詳細圖紙下方顯示所有當代已知的物體。\n"
"\n"
"發展是分開的：為初學者指南和公共關係提供的受歡迎的地圖以美麗的星座畫作插圖，但由於沒有顯示所有已知的天文內容而被棄用，而在專業觀測所（例如國際Cartes du Ciel項目）中使用的地圖則從任何線條上都被棄用。和星座圖，但僅描繪了恆星和星雲。\n"
"\n"
"後來，各種各樣的藝術家競相推薦棒圖，這些棒圖將星座區域內的一些亮星連接起來，但是這些建議最初沒有意義。因此，雷伊（Rey）在1952年提出的繪製簡筆劃觸發讀者幻想的建議產生了一定的影響：它表明，在過去的幾十年中，這些人物不再像他們被命名的人物那樣，對於初學者來說似乎是難以理解的。\n"

"HA Rey（Hans Augusto Reyersbach，1898-1977年）是德國血統的海報畫家，在紐約以兒童讀物的著者而異常成功。他對天文棒形人物問題的回答發表在《星星-看他們的新方法》（The Stars-A New Way To Seem）中（1952）。\n"
"\n"
"###星座\n"
"\n"
"在這本書中（特別是在美國非常流行），雷伊“以一種使得最終形狀有意義的方式，將每個星座的恆星聯繫在一起”。使他感到驚訝的是“以前沒有人做過。基本思想是如此簡單。”\n"
"\n"
"雷伊（Rey）的新棒形圖確實使識別所描繪的星座圖非常簡單。雷伊的作品不包括具象藝術品，因此，這種天空文化特意只與雷伊的原始簡筆劃一起出現。雷伊的星座名稱也總是用英語給出。如果切換到“本機”名稱顯示模式，則可能會準確看到其書中使用的拼寫。同樣，此處命名的星星僅限於本書中包含的星星。\n"
"\n"
"###雷伊的雕像和經典星座\n"
"\n"
"雷伊的星座遵循88個官方星座地區的現代國際天空文化傳統。但是，他包括一些通常用於定位的星號，例如希臘-巴比倫傳統的兩個北斗七星和“大廣場”（在飛馬和仙女座）。但是，雷伊的數字在某些方面與托勒密的《阿爾瑪格斯特》（公元2世紀）以來描述的經典數字有所不同，在托勒密的《阿爾瑪格斯特》中，星星的位置也以它們的名字進行了描述。例如：\n"
"\n"
"雷伊（Rey）顛倒了大熊（Ursa Major_）的身材，使其看起來像北極熊的獵物。一方面，這沒有通常的問題來解釋其長尾巴。另一方面，未示出熊在該方向上繞桿行走。\n"
"*公牛（_Taurus_）在通常的描繪中僅以長直的角示出了其前部，並以包括其尾巴的完整身體來示出，其角像水牛一樣被展寬。現在，它的明亮眼睛_Aldebaran_躺在脖子上。\n"
"*“大力神”的頭通常緊挨著“蛇夫座”的頭，蛇的持有人，並由四顆被稱為“梯形”的星星組成他的身體。雷伊（Rey）使自己的頭脫離了梯形，通常標記英雄頭部的星星現在已成為他的腳之一。\n"
"*希臘海怪（_Cetus_）被翻譯為“鯨魚”（與德語一樣，但錯誤），並且該圖已被轉過頭來，它的前嘴現在形成了尾鰭。\n"
"* _Pegasus_交換了腳和頭。\n"
"*牧民_Bootes_坐著並抽著煙斗（在1950年代的兒童讀物中沒有政治上的正確性……:-)"
