"Stellarium currently provides roughly 300 Chinese asterisms, called Xingguan (Chinese: 星官; pinyin: xīngguān, meaning: Star officials), and is without any Chinese star names. A project conducted by community member G.S.K.Lee is now underway to construct a complete Chinese sky culture set for Stellarium based on the information inside _Complete Studies of Astronomical Instruments_ (Chinese: 仪象考成; pinyin: Yíxiàngkǎochéng), an imperial record of astronomy finished in 1756. It was revised in 1844, published _The Continuation of Complete Studies of Astronomical Instruments_ (Chinese: 仪象考成续编; pinyin: Yíxiàngkǎochéng xùbiān), which is the major reference to the traditional Chinese Xingguans and star names used today.\n"
"\n"
"### Sun, Moon and Planets\n"
"\n"
"In western astronomy, the planets are named after gods. The ancient Chinese understanding of five planets is based on five-element concepts. The wood is green, the fire is red, the earth is yellow, the metal is white, the water is black. So, Mercury is named Water Star, Venus is named Metal Star, Mars is named Fire Star, Jupiter is named Wood Star, Saturn is named Earth Star.\n"
"\n"
"In Chinese, the Sun and the Moon are named after Yin and Yang (which contain \"great (Chinese:太, pinyin:tài)\"), respectively Taiyang (Sun, Chinese:太阳) and Taiyin (Moon. Chinese: 太阴, pinyin: tàiyīn). Their other name belongs to pictographic characters Ri (Sun, Chinese:日) and Yue (Moon, Chinese:月) but the more commonly used name for the moon is Yueliang (Chinese:月亮, pinyin: yuèliàng).\n"
"\n"
"The Sun, the Moon and the five planets form Seven Luminaries (Chinese:七曜,pinyin:qīyào), which correspond to the Five Elements and Yin and Yang.\n"
"\n"
"### Xingguans (asterisms)\n"
"\n"
"Traditional Chinese astronomy has a system of grouping stars to asterisms or constellations, known as \"Xingguan\". Their names and layout are very social, concerning the kingdom, the mountains, the goods, the industry in order to project everything of the world of humans into the sky.\n"
"\n"
"Most Xingguans are smaller than the constellations of Hellenistic tradition. In the Song dynasty (13th century), the Suzhou astronomical map was engraved in marble. It shows a total of 283 Xingguans, comprising a total of 1,565 individual stars. The Xingguan are divided into 31 regions, i.e. the 28 lunar mansions along the ecliptic, and the 3 enclosures of the northern sky. Due to precession, six Xingguans near the southern horizon became difficult to see and were not included.\n"
"\n"
"Before the Ming dynasty, Xingguans did not include the sky around the celestial south pole. The Southern Asterisms were added as a fifth group in the late Ming dynasty based on European star charts, comprising an additional 23 Xingguans.\n"
"\n"
"_Complete Studies of Astronomical Instruments_ has 300 Xingguans in total.\n"
"\n"
"Modern constellations refer to specific areas of the celestial sphere. Xingguans refer only to the way stars are distributed, with no specific boundaries between Xingguans.\n"
"\n"
"### Star names\n"
"\n"
"A Xingguan can contain from one to several dozens of stars. The so called single star asterisms among the Xingguans can be treated like star names. In Xingguan of two or more stars, each star has a number; the naming of stars in ancient China is the name of the Xingguan plus a number. However, there can be more than one way of numbering the stars within one asterism, thus, there can be more than one \"name\" for a certain star.\n"
"\n"
"Very few stars of the Xingguans have proper name additional to their number, e.g. alpha Leonis has the Chinese name \"the Queen's Star\" and is also referred to as \"Xuanyuan 14\" or (rarely) \"Xuanyuan 1\". The counting depends on the purpose (normal astronomy or observation of the Moon's path). \n"
"\n"
"In the traditional Chinese catalogues before 1650, coordinates were only given for one star per constellation, the so called main star or principle star [#1]. This is the star with the number \"1\" in the constellation where counting is started. It is usually the star with the westernmost right ascension. \n"
"\n"
"The Suzhou map  [#3] is based on coordinates and asterisms defined in antiquity which became canonical [#1],[#2] but later further stars were \"added stars\" (Chinese: 增星, pinyin:zēng xīng). The stars of the original catalogue are called \"proper stars\" (Chinese: 正星, pinyin: zhèng xīng). \n"
"\n"
"_The Continuation of Complete Studies of Astronomical Instruments_ has 3240 Stars names in total. Yi Shitong has conducted textual research and summary of these records in his book _Chinese and Western Contrast Star Chart and Catalogue 1950.0_ (Chinese: 中西对照恒星图表 1950.0; pinyin: Zhōngxī Duìzhào Héngxīng Túbiǎo).\n"
"\n"
"Unlike Xingguans, traditional Chinese star names are still in common usage today, even more common than Bayer/Flamsteed designations.\n"

"### Three Enclosures\n"
"\n"
"The 3 enclosures are regions which are summarizing many smaller asterisms. The enclosure of the Purple Forbidden Palace (Chinese: 紫微垣, pinyin: Zǐwēi yuán) surrounds almost the whole circumpolar area while the enclosures of the Supreme Palace (Chinese: 太微垣, pinyin: Tàiwēi yuán) and the Heavenly Market Place (Chinese: 天市垣, pinyin: Tiānshì yuán) are located close to the ecliptic.\n"
"\n"
"Each enclosure has two walls, called the left wall and the right wall which are the main xingguans. There are Xingguans at these \"wall\" asterisms (such as guards of the palace) as well as within the area that they are surrounding, e.g. within the Forbidden Palace xingguan, there are the xingguans of the Emperor, the Crown Prince and other. \n"
"\n"
"The Purple Forbidden Palace represents the inner palace of the emperor because the whole celestial sphere with all other xingguans is turning around this polar region. Thus, in the ancient Chinese belief, the Purple Forbidden Palace lies in the middle of the sky and covers the modern constellations Ursa Minor, Draco, Camelopardalis, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, Auriga, Boötes, and parts of Ursa Major, Canes Venatici, Leo Minor, Hercules. It contains 37 traditional xingguans.\n"
"\n"
"*   [Purple Forbidden Enclosure (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Forbidden_enclosure)\n"
"\n"
"The enclosure of the Supreme Palace is the place where the emperor and the courtiers deal with their politics. The Supreme Palace includes a variety of officials and government agencies, a total of 20 traditional Xingguans. It covers the modern constellations Virgo, Coma Berenices and Leo, and parts of Canes Venatici, Ursa Major and Leo Minor.\n"
"\n"
"*   [Supreme Palace Enclosure (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Palace_enclosure)\n"
"\n"
"Heavenly Market Enclosure is a bazaar in the sky, a place where ordinary people meet and are represented with their bazaar facilities in 19 xingguans. The Heavenly Market Place covers the modern constellations Serpens, Ophiuchus, Aquila and Corona Borealis, and parts of Hercules. \n"

"### Twenty-Eight Mansions (Xiù)\n"
"\n"
"The 28 Lunar Mansions (Chinese: 宿, pinyin: xiù) are slices of right ascensions that are bases in the path of the Moon ±5° around the ecliptic. The lunar mansion asterisms are not of equal size, they are 28 constellations north and south of the ecliptic but the regions of the Xiú (mansions) extend from there towards the equatorial pole where the right ascension lines intersect. The inital intention was to define the mansions in a way that the Moon changes the mansion every day but due to variability of the orbit and speed of the Moon, this concept does not apply any more. The smallest slice is only 1° right ascension. \n"
"\n"
"Traditional Chinese coordinates are given in \"degrees right ascension\" within a lunar mansion. The star where the measurement starts for this lunar mansion is called the determinative star (Chinese: 距星, pinyin: jùxīng) of the mansions. The equatorial degrees of the lodge (Chinese: 宿度, pinyin: xiùdù) are all right ascensions between the determinative star of a mansion the determinative star of the next one. However, the traditional Chinese right ascension \"degrees\" are smaller than in the sexagesimal system we are used to because the traditional Chinese \"degrees\" reflect the motion of the mean Sun as one degree per day. Thus, a Chinese \"degree\" is not 1/360 of the full circle but 1/365.25 of the circle. \n"
"\n"
"The 28 mansion asterisms are grouped into Four Holy Beasts (Chinese: 象 pinyin: xiàng), each containing seven mansions corresponding to seven luminaries. The Four Holy Beasts are the White Tiger of the East, The Red Bird of the South, the Azure Dragon of the West and the Dark Warrier of the North. As they all lay around the ecliptic, the association with the compass direction does not correspond to the real horizon.\n"

"\n"
"在西方天文学中，行星是以神命名的。中国古代对五颗行星的理解是基于五元素的概念。木头是绿色，火是红色，大地是黄色，金属是白色，水是黑色。因此，水星被命名为水星，金星被命名为金属星，火星被命名为火星，木星被命名为木星，土星被命名为地球星。\n"
"\n"
"在中文中，太阳和月亮分别以阴和阳（包含“大（中文：太，拼音：tài）”）命名，分别是太阳（阳，中文：太阳）和太阴（月亮。中文：太阴，拼音） ：tàiyīn）。它们的别称属于象形文字Ri（太阳，中文：日）和Yue（月亮，中文：月），但更常用的月球名字是Yueliang（汉语：月亮，拼音：yuèliàng）。\n"

"太阳，月亮和五个行星形成七个发光体（中文：七曜，拼音：qīyào），分别对应于五个元素以及阴阳。\n"
"\n"
"###星冠（星空）\n"
"\n"
"中国传统的天文学有一个将星团划分为星空或星座的系统，称为“星冠”。它们的名称和布局非常具有社会意义，涉及王国，山脉，商品和工业，以便将人类世界的所有事物投射到空中。\n"
"\n"
"大多数星冠都小于古希腊传统的星座。在宋朝（13世纪），苏州天文图刻在大理石上。它显示了总共283个星冠，包括总共1,565个单独的恒星。星冠分为31个区域，即沿黄道的28座月球豪宅和北部天空的3个围墙。由于进动，南地平线附近的六个星观变得很难看，没有包括在内。\n"

"现代星座是指天球的特定区域。星冠仅指恒星的分布方式，星冠之间没有特定的边界。\n"
"\n"
"###星星名称\n"
"\n"
"一个星冠可以包含一到几十颗恒星。星冠之间的所谓单星星象可以像星名一样对待。在两个或两个以上恒星的星冠中，每个恒星都有一个数字。中国古代的星星命名是星冠的名称加上一个数字。但是，对一个星号内的恒星进行编号的方法不只一种，因此，对于某颗恒星可以有多个“名称”。\n"
"\n"
"星冠中很少有星星具有其名称之外的专有名称，例如alpha Leonis的中文名称是“女王之星”，也被称为“轩yuan 14”或（很少有）“轩yuan 1”。计数取决于目的（正常的天文学或对月球路径的观察）。\n"
"\n"
"在1650年之前的繁体中文星表中，每个星座仅给出一颗恒星的坐标，即所谓的主星或主星[#1]。这是开始计数的星座中具有数字“ 1”的星星。通常是最西端向右提升的恒星。\n"
"\n"
"苏州地图[#3]基于古代定义的坐标和星号，这些坐标和星号已成为典范[#1]，[#2]，但后来的其他恒星是“附加星”（中文：增星，拼音：zēngxīng）。原始目录中的星星称为“适当的星星”（中文：正星，拼音：zhèngxīng）。\n"

"这种天空文化的基础是《中西对比星图和星表1950.0_（星表）》中的信息。 （中文：中西对照恒星图表1950.0（星表分册））和_天文仪器的完整研究_（中文：仪象考成）。\n"
"\n"
"特别感谢刘春斌对《中西对比星图和星表1950.0（星表）》的整理。他制作的《中国星状星表目录》（中文：Stellarium中国星官体系下中文星名扩展包）是非常重要的参考资料。\n"
"\n"
"为了翻译星座，使用香港太空馆制作了《中国星区，星空和星名的英汉词汇表》（中文：中国星区，星官及星名英译表）。只有一小部分翻译被更改，例如，两个不同的星冠的翻译是相同的。\n"
"\n"
"名称的文化含义无法完美地解释，因为数千年过去了，某些名称背后的含义存在争议。这些只是可能的翻译。"
