"Stellarium currently provides roughly 300 Chinese Xingguans (Chinese: 星官; pinyin: xīngguān, Meaning:Star officials) sets, and is without any Chinese star names. A project conducted by community member G.S.K.Lee is now underway to construct a complete Chinese sky culture set for Stellarium based on the information inside _Complete Studies of Astronomical Instruments_ (Chinese: 仪象考成; pinyin: Yíxiàngkǎochéng), an imperial record of astronomy finished in 1756. It was revised in 1844, published _The Continuation of Complete Studies of Astronomical Instruments_ (Chinese: 仪象考成续编; pinyin: Yíxiàngkǎochéng xùbiān), which is the major reference to the traditional Chinese Xingguans and star names used today.\n"
"\n"
"### Sun, Moon and Planets\n"
"\n"
"The Western countries named the planets in mythical characters. The ancient Chinese understanding of five planets is based on five-element concepts. The wood is green, the fire is red, the earth is yellow, the metal is white, the water is black. So, Mercury is named Water Star, Venus is named Metal Star, Mars is named Fire Star, Jupiter is named Wood Star, Saturn is named Earth Star.\n"
"\n"
"In Chinese, the sun and the moon are named after Yin and Yang (which contain \"great (Chinese:太, pinyin:tài)\"), respectively Taiyang (Sun, Chinese:太阳) and Taiyin (Moon，Chinese:太阴, pinyin:tàiyīn). Their other name belongs to pictographic characters Ri (Sun, Chinese:日) And Yue (Moon, Chinese:月). But the more commonly used name for the moon is Yueliang (Chinese:月亮, pinyin: yuèliàng).\n"
"\n"
"The sun, the moon and the five planets form Seven Luminaries (Chinese:七曜,pinyin:qīyào), which correspond to the Five Elements and Yin and Yang.\n"
"\n"
"### Xingguans\n"
"\n"
"Traditional Chinese astronomy has a system of dividing the celestial sphere into asterisms or constellations, known as \"Xingguan\" . \n"
"\n"
"The name and layout of the Xingguans are very social, the kingdom, the mountains, the goods, the industry all move to the sky, according to the Earth's way in the sky to copy a world.\n"
"\n"
"The Xingguans are generally smaller than the constellations of Hellenistic tradition. The Song dynasty (13th-century), Suzhou Stone Carving Astronomical Map shows a total of 283 Xingguans, comprising a total of 1,565 individual stars. The Xingguan are divided into 31 regions, the Twenty-Eight Mansions along the ecliptic, and the Three Enclosures of the northern sky. Due to the precession, six Xingguans near the southern horizon became difficult to see and were lost.\n"
"\n"
"Before the Ming Dynasty, Xingguans did not include the sky around the south celestial pole. The Southern Asterisms was added as a fifth group in the late Ming Dynasty based on European star charts, comprising an additional 23 Xingguans.\n"
"\n"
"_Complete Studies of Astronomical Instruments_ has 300 Xingguans in total.\n"
"\n"
"Modern constellations refer to specific areas of the celestial sphere. Xingguans refer only to the way stars are distributed, with no specific boundaries between Xingguans.\n"
"\n"
"### Star names\n"
"\n"
"A Xingguan contain more than dozens of stars, and fewer are only one. For Xingguan of two or more stars, each star has a number. The naming of stars in ancient China is the name of the Xingguan plus a number. But there are also a few Xingguans in which each star has a special name.\n"
"\n"
"In the Chinese catalogue, some of the stars are \"principle\" (Chinese:正星, pinyin:zhèngxīng). These stars were first discovered and well-known. On the contrary, some of the stars are \"added\" (Chinese:增星, pinyin:zēngxīng). They were recorded and named in later catalogues.\n"
"\n"
"_The Continuation of Complete Studies of Astronomical Instruments_ has 3240 Stars names in total. Yi Shitong has conducted textual research and summary of these records in his book _Chinese and Western Contrast Star Chart and Catalogue 1950.0_ (Chinese:中西对照恒星图表 1950.0; pinyin: Zhōngxī Duìzhào Héngxīng Túbiǎo ).\n"
"\n"
"Unlike Xingguans, traditional Chinese star names are still in common usage today, even more common than Bayer/Flamsteed designations.\n"

"### Three Enclosures\n"
"\n"
"Three Enclosures is three regions in the area around the ecliptic. Three Enclosures is Purple Forbidden Enclosure (Chinese:紫微垣,pinyin:Zǐwēiyuán),Supreme Palace Enclosure (Chinese:太微垣,pinyin:Tàiwēiyuán),Heavenly Market Enclosure (Chinese:天市垣,pinyin:Tiānshìyuán).\n"
"\n"
"Each Enclosure has two walls, called the left wall and the right wall which are the main Xingguans.The walls are surrounded by many Xingguans. There are also Xingguans in the vicinity of the wall that belong to this Enclosure.\n"
"\n"
"Purple Forbidden enclosure is the inner palace of the emperor, it covers the northernmost area of the night sky.From the viewpoint of the ancient Chinese, the Purple Forbidden Enclosure lies in the middle of the sky and is circled by all the other stars. It covers the modern constellations Ursa Minor, Draco, Camelopardalis, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, Auriga, Boötes, and parts of Ursa Major, Canes Venatici, Leo Minor, Hercules. Purple Forbidden enclosure has 37 Xingguans.\n"
"\n"
"*   [Purple Forbidden enclosure (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Forbidden_enclosure)\n"
"\n"
"Supreme Palace Enclosure is the place where the emperor and the courtiers deal with their politics. Supreme Palace Enclosure has a variety of officials and government agencies.It covers the modern constellations Virgo, Coma Berenices and Leo, and parts of Canes Venatici, Ursa Major and Leo Minor. Supreme Palace Enclosure has 20 Xingguans.\n"

"*   [Supreme Palace Enclosure (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Palace_enclosure)\n"
"\n"
"Heavenly Market Enclosure is a bazaar in the sky, a place where ordinary people live.The Heavenly Market Enclosure covers the modern constellations Serpens, Ophiuchus, Aquila and Corona Borealis, and parts of Hercules. Heavenly Market Enclosure has 19 Xingguans. They were named after the participants of the bazaar and the facilities of the bazaar.\n"

"### Twenty-Eight Mansions\n"
"\n"
"The Twenty-Eight Mansions(28 Lunar Mansions) is the ancient China divides the ecliptic and the sky area near the equator to divide into 28 regions according to the right ascension. Each region is called a Mansion (Chinese:宿,pinyin:xiù)，the Ancients let the Moon change a Mansion every day to rest.\n"
"\n"
"Each mansion has a Xingguan of the same name near the ecliptic, which is the main Xingguan.Where the constellation in this area belongs to the Mansion.\n"
"\n"
"The star used to measure the Right ascension standard is called the Determinative Star (Chinese:距星,pinyin:jùxīng) of the Mansions. The difference between the Determinative Star of the Mansion and the Determinative Star of the next Mansion on the Right ascension is the equatorial lodge degrees (Chinese:宿度,pinyin:xiùdù) of the Mansion. The traditional equatorial coordinate system of China divides the equator into 365.25 degrees, and the Sun runs one day for one degree.\n"
"\n"
"The Twenty-Eight Mansions are grouped into Four Symbols (Chinese:象pinyin:xiàng), each associated with a compass direction and containing seven Mansions，corresponds to Seven Luminaries.\n"
