"The Sioux are several tribes in the Northeast American cultural group (United\n"
"States and Canada). They formed a first \"nation\" known as the _Oceti Sakowin_,\n"
"the Seven (Council) Fires. This council of seven consists of: four Dakota\n"
"bands, two Nakota bands and one Lakota band, where D/N/L are dialectic\n"
"distinctions. The word D(N/L)akota means \"Alliance\".\n"
"\n"
"The term \"Sioux\" was possibly impolite: It stems from colonial time and is a\n"
"French shortform of the Ojibwe word \"Nadouessioux\" meaning \"little snakes\"\n"
"which was a metaphor for enemies of the Ojibwe. The correct term is Dakota,\n"
"Lakota, and Nakota."
