"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"As with many cultures, constellations were identified and used to help keep track of the seasons and predict the seasonal variations which affect daily life. In the book _Histoire de la Mission de Pères Capucins en l'Isle de Maragnan etterres circonvoisins_, published in Paris, 1614, it is stated that the Tupi people identified some thirty constellations but the book only details seven.\n"
"\n"
"#### Ema\n"
"\n"
"The Tupi name for this constellation is _Iandutim_ (_Guirá Nhandu_ inGuarani), which literally translates to _White Ostrich_. The constellation depicts a large bird. \n"
"\n"
"In the first two weeks of June this constellation is fully visible in the Eastern sky in the evening, indicating the beginning of Winter in the South of Brazil, and the start of the dry season in the North.\n"
"\n"
"#### Homem Velho (the Old Man)\n"
