"The Maori (New Zealand) night sky is similar to the Polynesian night sky. "
"But it differs enough to warrant it's own sky culture. Maritime themes are "
"central to the Maori sky culture and were used extensively in nautical "
"navigation. Along with most other cultures, the rising and setting of "
"prominent stars were used to signal planting and harvesting seasons."
