# Arabic

## Introduction

The Arabic sky culture, which is in use for more than a thousand years, has
been influenced greatly by Greek astronomy, particularly by Ptolemy's astronomy
but also by the traditions of the nomads from the Arabic peninsula.

## Description

_Ptolemy_, the Greek astronomer who lived and worked around _100-178 CE_ in
Alexandria, Egypt, collected ancient Greek descriptions of 1,022 stars in his
famous book _The Great System of Astronomy_, popularised under its shortened
Arabic title, the _Almagest_. His catalogue of stars listed coordinates
and brightness estimates for the stars arranged in _48 constellations_.

The _Almagest_ was translated into Arabic twice in the 9th century and
the Arabic translation was then translated into Medieval Latin. Thus, many
modern star names are based on the star descriptions in the Arabic Almagest.

### Constellations

This Arabic sky culture uses the classical _48 constellations_ of the Greek
_Almagest_. These constellations were described by several Arab and Islamic
authors. One of them left an indelible influence on the Arabic observation and
study of stars: the astronomer _Abū al-Husayn ‘Abd Al-Rahmān al-Sūfī_
(903-986), known also by his Latinized name of _Azophi_. _Al-Sūfī_ produced a
revised and updated version of Ptolemy's _Almagest_ in a major book called
_Kitab suwar al-kawakib_, _The Book of Fixed Stars_ [#4], completed around 964
CE. Built on the basis of the Greek astronomical heritage, the work of
_Al-Sūfī_ contained a listing of the Arabs' star names, stars magnitudes
determined by _al-Sūfī_ himself, and two drawings of each constellation, one as
it is seen in the sky and one reversed right to left as it would appear on a
celestial globe. The oldest surviving copy was produced by his son around _1010
CE_ and is preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford (MS Marsh 144).

### The origin of star names

In the Almagest, stars were described by their position within the
constellation figure, e.g. "the star at the tip of the Bird's tail". In the
arabic version of the map the label was shortened to the term "tail", "danab"
in Arabic. Other star names used by _al-Sūfī_ and his compatriots were direct
translations from Ptolemy's descriptions. For example, the modern star name
_Fomalhaut_ comes from the Arabic "mouth of the southern fish", which is where
_Ptolemy_ had described the star's position in the _Almagest_.

Other star names describe the star itself, such as _Sirius_, which is derived
from the Greek original and means "the brightest one" (literally as
"scorching"). Another name describing the star's appearance is _Algol_, derived
from the name of a desert demon whose Arabic name was "The Ghoul", whose eye is
twinkeling at us. Quite a lot of prominent stars bear Arabic names, in which
"al" corresponds to the article "the" but its inclusion has become somewhat
arbitrary over time. Several star names of Arabic origin are given with or
without the al- prefix.

Local tradition of the peoples of _Islamic lands_ in the Arabian Peninsula and
in the Middle East had their own names for various bright stars such as
_Aldebaran_, The Follower (of the Star Cluster we name the Pleiades). They
usually regarded single stars as representing _animals or people_, e.g. Diphda
(_beta Ceti_), the Second Frog. The stars we know as _Alpha_ and _Beta
Ophiuchi_ were regarded as a _shepherd_ and _his dog_, while neighbouring stars
made up the outlines of a _field with sheep_. Some of the Arabic names were
already many centuries old and their meanings were lost even for _al-Sūfī_ and
his contemporaries, and they remain unknown until today.
