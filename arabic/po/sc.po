"The depiction of Orion, as seen from Earth (left) and a mirror-image, from a\n"
"13th-century copy of al-Sufi's _Book of Fixed Stars_ [#4]. In this version,\n"
"Orion's shield has become a long sleeve, typical of Islamic dress.\n"
"{: .img_and_caption }\n"
"\n"
"_Ptolemy_, the Greek astronomer who lived and worked around _100-178 CE_ in\n"
"Alexandria, Egypt, collected ancient Greek descriptions of 1,022 stars in his\n"
"famous book _The Great System of Astronomy_, popularised under its shortened\n"
"Arabic title, the _Almagest_. His catalogue of stars listed coordinates\n"
"and brightness estimates for the stars arranged in _48 constellations_.\n"
"\n"
"The _Almagest_ was translated into Arabic twice in the 9th century and\n"
"the Arabic translation was then translated into Medieval Latin. Thus, many\n"
"modern star names are based on the star descriptions in the Arabic Almagest.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"This Arabic sky culture uses the classical _48 constellations_ of the Greek\n"
"_Almagest_. These constellations were described by several Arab and Islamic\n"
"authors. One of them left an indelible influence on the Arabic observation and\n"
"study of stars: the astronomer _Abū al-Husayn ‘Abd Al-Rahmān al-Sūfī_\n"
"(903-986), known also by his Latinized name of _Azophi_. _Al-Sūfī_ produced a\n"
"revised and updated version of Ptolemy's _Almagest_ in a major book called\n"
"_Kitab suwar al-kawakib_, _The Book of Fixed Stars_ [#4], completed around 964\n"
"CE. Built on the basis of the Greek astronomical heritage, the work of\n"
"_Al-Sūfī_ contained a listing of the Arabs' star names, stars magnitudes\n"
"determined by _al-Sūfī_ himself, and two drawings of each constellation, one as\n"
"it is seen in the sky and one reversed right to left as it would appear on a\n"
"celestial globe. The oldest surviving copy was produced by his son around _1010\n"
"CE_ and is preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford (MS Marsh 144).\n"

"Cetus as seen in the sky in an old manuscript of Al-Sufi book [#3].\n"
"{: .img_and_caption }\n"
"\n"
"### The origin of star names\n"
"\n"
"In the Almagest, stars were described by their position within the\n"
"constellation figure, e.g. \"the star at the tip of the Bird's tail\". In the\n"
"arabic version of the map the label was shortened to the term \"tail\", \"danab\"\n"
"in Arabic. Other star names used by _al-Sūfī_ and his compatriots were direct\n"
"translations from Ptolemy's descriptions. For example, the modern star name\n"
"_Fomalhaut_ comes from the Arabic \"mouth of the southern fish\", which is where\n"
"_Ptolemy_ had described the star's position in the _Almagest_.\n"
"\n"
"Other star names describe the star itself, such as _Sirius_, which is derived\n"
"from the Greek original and means \"the brightest one\" (literally as\n"
"\"scorching\"). Another name describing the star's appearance is _Algol_, derived\n"
"from the name of a desert demon whose Arabic name was \"The Ghoul\", whose eye is\n"
"twinkeling at us. Quite a lot of prominent stars bear Arabic names, in which\n"
"\"al\" corresponds to the article \"the\" but its inclusion has become somewhat\n"
"arbitrary over time. Several star names of Arabic origin are given with or\n"
"without the al- prefix.\n"
"\n"
"Local tradition of the peoples of _Islamic lands_ in the Arabian Peninsula and\n"
"in the Middle East had their own names for various bright stars such as\n"
"_Aldebaran_, The Follower (of the Star Cluster we name the Pleiades). They\n"
"usually regarded single stars as representing _animals or people_, e.g. Diphda\n"
"(_beta Ceti_), the Second Frog. The stars we know as _Alpha_ and _Beta\n"
"Ophiuchi_ were regarded as a _shepherd_ and _his dog_, while neighbouring stars\n"
"made up the outlines of a _field with sheep_. Some of the Arabic names were\n"
"already many centuries old and their meanings were lost even for _al-Sūfī_ and\n"
"his contemporaries, and they remain unknown until today."
