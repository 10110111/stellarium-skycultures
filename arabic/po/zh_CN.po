"The depiction of Orion, as seen from Earth (left) and a mirror-image, from a 13th-century copy of al-Sufi's _Book of Fixed Stars_ [#4]. In this version, Orion's shield has become a long sleeve, typical of Islamic dress.\n"

"_Ptolemy_, the Greek astronomer who lived and worked around _100-178 CE_ in Alexandria, Egypt, collected ancient Greek descriptions of 1,022 stars in his famous book _The Great System of Astronomy_, popularised under its shortened Arabic title, the _Almagest_.\n"
"Ptolemy's catalogue of stars arranged into _48 constellations_, with estimates of their brightness, based largely on the observations of the Greek earlier astronomers, such as _Hipparchus_.\n"
"\n"
"Ptolemy's book was translated twice into Arabic in the 9th century and became famous. Many of the Arabic-language star descriptions in the Almagest came to be used widely as names for stars.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"This Arabic sky culture uses the classical _48 constellations_ of the Greeks.\n"
"These constellations were described by several Arab and Islamic authors, one of those who left an indelible influence on the Arabic observation and study of stars is the astronomer _Abū al-Husayn ‘Abd Al-Rahmān al-Sūfī_ (903-986), known also by his Latinized name of _Azophi_, who systematically revised Ptolemy's catalogue of stars.\n"
"_Al-Sūfī_ produced a revised and updated version of Ptolemy's _Almagest_ in a major book called _Kitab suwar al-kawakib_, _The Book of Fixed Stars_ [#4], completed around 964 CE.\n"
"Built on the basis of the Greek astronomical heritage, the work of _Al-Sūfī_ contained a listing of the Arabs' own star names, magnitudes determined by _al-Sūfī_ himself, and two drawings of each constellation, one as it is seen in the sky and one reversed right to left as it would appear on a celestial globe.\n"
"The oldest surviving copy was produced by his son around _1010 CE_ and is preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford (MS Marsh 144).\n"

"\n"
"### The origin of star names\n"
"\n"
"Regardless of origin, almost all star names belong to old traditions. They are a part of the collective cultural heritage of humanity.\n"
"\n"
"Official star names are essentially limited to the _old names_, and typically only bright stars have names. The majority of stars names are related to their constellation, e.g., the star _Deneb_ means \"tail\" and labels that part of _Cygnus_ the Swan.\n"
"\n"
"Others describe the star itself, such as _Sirius_, which translates literally as \"scorching\", apt enough for the brightest star in the sky. Quite a lot of prominent stars bear Arabic names, in which \"al\" corresponds to the article \"the\" and often appears in front, e.g., _Algol, \"The Ghoul\". Its inclusion has become somewhat arbitrary over time. Hence, several star names of Arabic origin are given elsewhere with or without the al- prefix. Most other names of stars inherited from the past have _Greek, Latin or Chinese_ labels.\n"
"\n"
"When the Arabic texts were translated into Latin beginning from the _12th century_, the Arabic tradition of star names was passed down to the Latin world. However, this happened often in a highly corrupted form that either changed the meaning, or in extreme cases gave birth to words with no meaning at all. Other names were mistakenly transferred from one star to another, so that a name might even refer to a different constellation (Greek or Arabic) rather than to the one of the star's actual residence.\n"
"\n"
"Nevertheless, even with these shortcomings, the majority of star names adopted since the Renaissance are Arabic in origin.\n"
"\n"
"Local tradition of the peoples of _Islamic lands_ in the Arabian Peninsula and in the Middle East had their own names for various bright stars such as _Aldebaran_, and they commonly regarded single stars as representing _animals or people_. For example, the stars we know as _Alpha_ and _Beta Ophiuchi_ were regarded by them as a _shepherd_ and _his dog_, while neighbouring stars made up the outlines of a _field with sheep_. Some of the Arabic names were already so many centuries old that their meanings were lost even to _al-Sūfī_ and his contemporaries, and they remain unknown today. Other star names used by _al-Sūfī_ and his compatriots were direct translations of Ptolemy's descriptions. For example, the star name _Fomalhaut_ comes from the Arabic meaning \"mouth of the southern fish\", which is where _Ptolemy_ had described it in the _Almagest_.\n"

"希腊天文学家托勒密（Ptolemy_）在埃及亚历山大（Alexandria）居住和工作于公元100-178年左右，并在他的著名著作《天文学的大系统》（The Great System of Astronomy_）中搜集了古希腊对1,022颗恒星的描述，并以阿拉伯语简称_Almagest_广为传播。\n"
"托勒密的星表排列成48个星座，并估计它们的亮度，这主要是基于希腊早期的天文学家（如希普帕库斯）的观测结果。\n"
"\n"
"托勒密的书在9世纪被两次翻译成阿拉伯语并广为人知。 Almagest中许多阿拉伯语的恒星描述已被广泛用作恒星的名称。\n"
"\n"
"###星座\n"
"\n"
"这种阿拉伯的天空文化使用了希腊人的经典48个星座。\n"
"这些星座是由几位阿拉伯和伊斯兰作家描述的，其中一位对天文学家_Abūal-Husayn'AbdAl-Rahmānal-Sūfī_（903-986）产生了不可磨灭的影响的阿拉伯人对恒星的观察和研究以他的拉丁名字_Azophi_命名，他系统地修改了托勒密的星表。\n"
"_Al-Sūfī_在称为_Kitab suwar al-kawakib_的一本主要著作《固定恒星之书》 [#4]中完成了托勒密的_Almagest_的修订和更新版本，该书于964年左右完成。\n"
"_Al-Sūfī_的作品建立在希腊天文遗产的基础上，其中包含阿拉伯人自己的星星名称清单，_al-Sūfī_本人确定的星等以及每个星座的两张图纸，其中一张是在天空中看到的一个像在天球仪上一样从右向左反转。\n"
"幸存下来的最古老的副本是在公元1010年左右由他的儿子生产的，并保存在牛津的Bodleian图书馆（MS Marsh 144）。\n"

"\n"
"###星星名称的由来\n"
"\n"
"无论起源如何，几乎所有的明星名字都属于古老的传统。它们是人类集体文化遗产的一部分。\n"
"\n"
"正式的星星名称基本上仅限于“旧名称”，通常只有明亮的星星才有名称。大多数星星的名字都与它们的星座有关，例如，星星_Deneb_的意思是“尾巴”，并标记了天鹅天鹅的一部分。\n"
"\n"
"其他人描述了恒星本身，例如_Sirius_，其字面翻译为“灼热”，足以适应天空中最亮的恒星。很多突出的星星都带有阿拉伯名称，其中“ al”对应于“ the”一词，并且经常出现在前面，例如_Algol，“ The Ghoul”。随着时间的推移，其包含已变得有些武断。因此，在其他地方给出了几个阿拉伯起源的星名，带或不带前缀。从过去继承的大多数其他恒星名称都带有_Greek，Latin或Chinese_标签。\n"
"\n"
"从十二世纪开始，阿拉伯语文本被翻译成拉丁文时，阿拉伯文的星名传统就传承到了拉丁世界。但是，这种情况经常以严重损坏的形式发生，或者改变了含义，或者在极端情况下产生了根本没有含义的单词。其他名称被错误地从一颗恒星转移到另一颗恒星，因此，一个名称甚至可能指向不同的星座（希腊语或阿拉伯语），而不是恒星的实际居住地。\n"
"\n"
"尽管如此，即使有这些缺点，自文艺复兴以来采用的大多数明星名称都起源于阿拉伯语。\n"
"\n"
"阿拉伯半岛和中东地区伊斯兰地区人民的当地传统对各种明亮的恒星（例如，Aldebaran_）都有自己的名字，他们通常将单颗恒星视为代表动物或人类。例如，被我们称为_Alpha_和_Beta Ophiuchi_的恒星被它们视为_shepherd_和_his dog_，而相邻的恒星则用绵羊_组成了_field的轮廓。一些阿拉伯名字已经有数百年的历史了，以至于甚至使al-Sūfī_和他的同时代人都失去了它们的含义，而今天它们仍然不为人所知。 _al-Sūfī_和他的同胞所使用的其他星级名称是托勒密描述的直接翻译。例如，星星名称_Fomalhaut_来自阿拉伯语，意为“南方鱼的嘴”，这是_Ptolemy_在_Almagest_中描述的地方。\n"
