"The depiction of Orion, as seen from Earth (left) and a mirror-image, from a 13th-century copy of al-Sufi's _Book of Fixed Stars_ [#4]. In this version, Orion's shield has become a long sleeve, typical of Islamic dress.\n"

"_Ptolemy_, the Greek astronomer who lived and worked around _100-178 CE_ in Alexandria, Egypt, collected ancient Greek descriptions of 1,022 stars in his famous book _The Great System of Astronomy_, popularised under its shortened Arabic title, the _Almagest_.\n"
"Ptolemy's catalogue of stars arranged into _48 constellations_, with estimates of their brightness, based largely on the observations of the Greek earlier astronomers, such as _Hipparchus_.\n"
"\n"
"Ptolemy's book was translated twice into Arabic in the 9th century and became famous. Many of the Arabic-language star descriptions in the Almagest came to be used widely as names for stars.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"This Arabic sky culture uses the classical _48 constellations_ of the Greeks.\n"
"These constellations were described by several Arab and Islamic authors, one of those who left an indelible influence on the Arabic observation and study of stars is the astronomer _Abū al-Husayn ‘Abd Al-Rahmān al-Sūfī_ (903-986), known also by his Latinized name of _Azophi_, who systematically revised Ptolemy's catalogue of stars.\n"
"_Al-Sūfī_ produced a revised and updated version of Ptolemy's _Almagest_ in a major book called _Kitab suwar al-kawakib_, _The Book of Fixed Stars_ [#4], completed around 964 CE.\n"
"Built on the basis of the Greek astronomical heritage, the work of _Al-Sūfī_ contained a listing of the Arabs' own star names, magnitudes determined by _al-Sūfī_ himself, and two drawings of each constellation, one as it is seen in the sky and one reversed right to left as it would appear on a celestial globe.\n"
"The oldest surviving copy was produced by his son around _1010 CE_ and is preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford (MS Marsh 144).\n"

"### The origin of star names\n"
"\n"
"Regardless of origin, almost all star names belong to old traditions. They are a part of the collective cultural heritage of humanity.\n"
"\n"
"Official star names are essentially limited to the _old names_, and typically only bright stars have names. The majority of stars names are related to their constellation, e.g., the star _Deneb_ means \"tail\" and labels that part of _Cygnus_ the Swan.\n"
"\n"
"Others describe the star itself, such as _Sirius_, which translates literally as \"scorching\", apt enough for the brightest star in the sky. Quite a lot of prominent stars bear Arabic names, in which \"al\" corresponds to the article \"the\" and often appears in front, e.g., _Algol, \"The Ghoul\". Its inclusion has become somewhat arbitrary over time. Hence, several star names of Arabic origin are given elsewhere with or without the al- prefix. Most other names of stars inherited from the past have _Greek, Latin or Chinese_ labels.\n"
"\n"
"When the Arabic texts were translated into Latin beginning from the _12th century_, the Arabic tradition of star names was passed down to the Latin world. However, this happened often in a highly corrupted form that either changed the meaning, or in extreme cases gave birth to words with no meaning at all. Other names were mistakenly transferred from one star to another, so that a name might even refer to a different constellation (Greek or Arabic) rather than to the one of the star's actual residence.\n"
"\n"
"Nevertheless, even with these shortcomings, the majority of star names adopted since the Renaissance are Arabic in origin.\n"
"\n"
"Local tradition of the peoples of _Islamic lands_ in the Arabian Peninsula and in the Middle East had their own names for various bright stars such as _Aldebaran_, and they commonly regarded single stars as representing _animals or people_. For example, the stars we know as _Alpha_ and _Beta Ophiuchi_ were regarded by them as a _shepherd_ and _his dog_, while neighbouring stars made up the outlines of a _field with sheep_. Some of the Arabic names were already so many centuries old that their meanings were lost even to _al-Sūfī_ and his contemporaries, and they remain unknown today. Other star names used by _al-Sūfī_ and his compatriots were direct translations of Ptolemy's descriptions. For example, the star name _Fomalhaut_ comes from the Arabic meaning \"mouth of the southern fish\", which is where _Ptolemy_ had described it in the _Almagest_.\n"
