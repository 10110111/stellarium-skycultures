"Depending on the region, Ojibwe are known for birch bark canoes, wildrice-_manoomin_, and maple syrup. Also known as Anishinaabe and Chippewa. The word Ojibwe means ‘cooks food outside’. The Ojibwe Star Knowledge files available for Stellarium are an adaptation of the ___“Ojibwe Giizhig Anung Masinaaigan, Ojibiwe Sky Star Map”___, created by A. Lee, W. Wilson, C. Gawboy, 2012. More details can be found in the constellation guidebook ___Ojibwe Sky Star Map Constellation Guide: An Introduction to Ojibwe Star Knowledge___. Also available are Ojibwe star map posters, Ojibwe planispheres, curriculum, and other resources.\n"
