# Ojibwe

## Introduction

Ojibwe are one of the largest groups of indigenous people of North America
(United States and Canada). Depending on the region, Ojibwe are known for birch
bark canoes, wild rice (_manoomin_), and maple syrup.

## Description

The word Ojibwe means ‘cooks food outside’. They are also known as
_Anishinaabe_ and _Chippewa_.

The Ojibwe Star Knowledge files available for Stellarium are an adaptation of
the _Ojibiwe Sky Star Map_[#4]. More details can be found in the constellation
guidebook _Ojibwe Sky Star Map Constellation Guide: An Introduction to Ojibwe
Star Knowledge_.

Please also see the neighboring "Sioux" Sky Culture which is comparable in
northeast America.
